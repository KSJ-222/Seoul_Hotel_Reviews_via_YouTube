It takes about 1 hour and 20 minutes from Incheon Airport to here. From exit 5, continue straight. It took about 7 minutes to get here. Go to the right at \"Jongno Tteokjip\" There is a hotel building right in front! It took about 8 minutes to get here. Here\u0027s how to get to the hotel from Jongno 3-ga Station Exit 5. Come to the musical instrument store as shown in the video. Once you cross the traffic light You will see the hotel building in front of you, turn right It took about 5 minutes to get here. The hotel lobby has a cozy feel. Check-in time is 4:00 PM, and check-out time is 11:00 AM. We booked on Agoda for $220 for 3people. There are 2-bed deluxe and 2-bed premier apartments, and I will introduce you to the slightly more expensive premier apartment. To check in, insert and remove the room card. As soon as you enter, there is a shoe rack and  many storage cabinets on the right. Indoor slippers are not disposable items. There is a kitchen on the left There is a dining table for four. The kitchen is well equipped with gas stove,  oven, rice cooker, toaster, etc. Pots, frying pans, etc. are very clean. The refrigerator is very clean and very big.  However, they do not provide bottled water. I booked a room for 3 people,  but all kitchen utensils are provided for 4 people. It looks really clean and well organized. If you are looking for a clean residence hotel,  this is the perfect place. The sink is very clean. The microwave oven also has good performance. There is a dishwasher. The TV is big, but it doesn\u0027t have OTT service. There is a small study area.  It feels like a bit of a service area. The view was good.   You can see the park and the Blue House. A clean residence hotel in the heart of Seoul.  I highly recommend it. There are quite a few doors This is the second room on the right. There is a queen size bed,  a small desk and storage space. The bed mattress is a slightly firm style,  and the pillows and blankets are soft. Because it is a central heating and cooling system, there are control systems located throughout the system so that it can be adjusted. This is the innermost master room. There is a king size bed and a small TV. The bed was very clean A slightly firm mattress and soft blankets and pillows It was raining and gloomy,  but the view was pretty good. There is a large closet.  There is a safe and a bathrobe. There are hangers, hair dryers, etc. There is an empty space with nothing.  You can see Seoul Tower well from here. This is the master bedroom bathroom. Starting in April 2024, a law restricting the provision of disposable products will be enacted, banning the provision of disposable toothbrushes, toothpaste, razors, etc. The shower room is very waterproof. The bathtub is narrow and long.  There is absolutely no water stains or mold. The toilet is a bidet. There is regular shampoo,  body shampoo, and body lotion. There is no smell in the bathroom and it is very clean. The second bathroom has a washing machine.  However, there is no detergent. There are small stairs. The shower room is very well waterproofed. The toilet is a regular toilet. There is only regular shampoo and body shampoo here. The rooms are clean and of a decent quality,  so I recommend it. Now, shall we go and see the hotel facilities? Touch the sticker side of the room card,  select the desired floor, and press Enter. The gym is very large and well maintained. All the facilities are located on the second floor. The kids room has only one facility and is rather small. But, regardless, the kids love it so much. There is a swimming pool right next door.  The facilities are better than I thought. The small pool is about 60cm deep.  The adult pool is about 1.2m deep. There is a restaurant right next to the pool. As soon as you enter, there are drinks on the right. The restaurant is spacious. The variety of bread is a bit disappointing. It costs about $13.50 per person,  so the selection is limited. Carrot soup and seaweed soup and scrambled eggs Tomato pasta, rice and pork cutlet There are various sauces and seaweed. There\u0027s pineapple lettuce dressing green grapes and banana. There are bowls and plates and spoons for babies,  and there is cereal and milk. There aren\u0027t many varieties, but the taste was good. The tomato pasta and seaweed soup were especially delicious. \"Onion\" located at Exit 3 of Anguk Station A special place where you can eat Korean bread in a Hanok I recommend it for the atmosphere rather than the taste. More than 90% of our guests are foreign tourists. I recommend Jongro Bossam Alley. \"Jongno 3-ga Janggun Oyster Bossam\" You can enjoy bossam, gamjatang,  and oysters for 38,000 won. For more information, please check the description or comments below. Insadong\u0027s main street is just  to the left of the hotel\u0027s main entrance. There are lots of things to see and places to buy gifts. There are also unique brick sands. There\u0027s a fun convenience store on the second floor. Robots make lattes. Robots make ice cream. Robots make pizza. But you can cook Korean ramen yourself.  Hahahaha"}

Go straight ahead If you walk for about 2 minutes,  you will see the Seoul City Tour bus stop. If you get a chance, definitely ride it It took about 3 minutes to get to the \"Koreana\" hotel. There is an airport bus stop right in front of the hotel. The \"GLOCALOCA\" hotel is located  on the 19th and 20th floors of the \"Koreana\" hotel. The area surrounding the hotel is full of famous landmarks. I booked it for $105 per night for 2 people. If you come to the 20th floor,  you can check in at the welcome desk. Check-in is at 3pm and check-out is at 11am. As soon as you enter, there is a clean bathroom on the right. As soon as you enter, there are 4 disposable slippers and a hanger on the right. The shoes were thin but sturdy. There is a clean restroom on the left. 8 towels, toothbrushes, and toothpaste are provided. There is also cleansing foam and hand wash! The shower room is clean, but there is no door in the shower booth. It was nice to have a middle door The first feeling was warm There is a very small refrigerator and fire extinguisher on the right. The fridge is a bit small. But the shared kitchen is very well-equipped. The TV is a smart TV that can watch Netflix, YouTube, etc. The table is wide so it is very useful The windows are double-glazed to block out noise. The view from the room overlooks the entire Gwanghwamun. Women\u0027s unique sensibility The bed is not of luxury hotel quality. It is ordinary. The mattress is moderately firm. It\u0027s a queen size bed. There was no crib guard here, so I pushed the bed against the wall. Overall, spacious room for the price, average bed But, good location for sightseeing and convenient transportation! But! I really like the shared kitchen. Let\u0027s take a look together! The communal kitchen is much nicer than I expected. Open 24 hours. Complimentary coffee, cocoa, ramen, cereal and milk. Air fryer, rice cooker, ice maker, microwave, electric range, dishwasher It\u0027s much neater than I thought. A water purifier, a clean sink, and various kitchen utensils are provided. You can taste Korean ramen to your heart\u0027s content. The feeling of space is also very cozy. There are two types of cereal available. There is also a communal kitchen on the 19th floor, but it is a bit smaller. All cooking facilities are well equipped. This is a shared refrigerator for guests. It is smaller than the 20th floor, but it is a good facility. You can see the shared office right away. There are spaces from single-person spaces to open spaces. In my opinion, I like the facilities more than the rooms. There is even a private meeting room. There are also public, clean restrooms here. The communal laundry room has a washing machine that you can use free of charge. There is one large washing machine and one dryer, and free detergent is also provided. There is no pool or gym, but I am satisfied. If you walk to the left of the hotel for about 6 minutes, you will reach Gwanghwamun Square. If you walk for about 10 more minutes, you will reach Gyeongbokgung Palace. You can take a free commemorative photo around 12:10 PM. It\u0027s great to rent a hanbok and wear it and take pretty pictures! For more information, please refer to the comments below ⬇️ This time, walk to the right of the hotel for about 3 minutes. If you walk 2 more minutes from here, you will reach Deoksugung Palace. Turn right first! If you go up for about 2 more minutes,  there is an elevator on the right. Press the \"R\" floor and come to the rooftop. This place offers a great view that is not well known. Go to Deoksugung Palace. It\u0027s about a 4-minute walk. As soon as you enter, you can see souvenirs at the \"sarang\" cafe on the right. It\u0027s pretty and of good quality. You can have a great time at Deoksugung Palace. Across from the hotel are City Hall Plaza and Cheonggyecheon Stream. You can have a good time here too This is not a famous restaurant, but it is a place worth experiencing. There is a “BBQ village” right next to Cheonggyecheon. Luckily, I was assigned a room. If you walk about 5 minutes from here towards Jongno, there is a famous restaurant called “Gwanghwamun Mijin.” There is usually a waiting time of about 20 minutes. Buckwheat soba and pork bossam are famous. Please leave comments and likes for our family"}

Take subway lines 3 and 4  to Chungmuro ​​Station, exit 8. There is an airport bus stop immediately to the right. The hotel is right behind exit 8! It\u0027s so close that there\u0027s no need to explain. The hotel is located right in front of  airport bus stops 6001 and 6015. For more information, please see the  description or comments below. The hotel I will introduce to you today is suitable for  4 or more people (up to 6 people). The hotel information desk is small,  but neat and cozy. You will be given a total of 4 room card keys.  The elevator is very comfortable. The suite is located on the 10th floor and has two rooms. We were assigned room 1001. It was much wider than I thought We paid about $180 USD per night for 6 people. 3 double beds 2 bathrooms 2 refrigerators 2 tvs The toilet, shower room, and sink are all separate. This place provides amenities such as disposable  toothbrushes and toothpaste. There is a large spa facility. You can see Seoul Tower from your room. The bed is in good condition. There is a safe, a hanger, and slippers next to the bed. There is a sofa, a TV, and a refrigerator. You can get bottled water for free from the refrigerator next  to the front desk on the first floor. Here too, there is a refrigerator, hangers, slippers and a safe. It\u0027s a little disappointing that these aren\u0027t disposable slippers. We used the two double beds here by putting them  together to create a spacious space. The bed is very soft. You can see the Seoul Tower view  from anywhere in the room. Another bathroom features a luxurious bathtub. Likewise, the toilet, shower room, and faucet are separate. Amenities such as disposable toothbrushes  and toothpaste are also provided. The bathroom fixtures are luxurious Italian products. The luxurious and large bathtub is attractive. It\u0027s hard to find this level of quality for the price  of one night in a six-person hotel in the heart of Seoul. The spa facilities in particular were great for parties. It took an hour and a half to fill the spa halfway with water. If you have a family of 4 or more,  I would definitely recommend this place. Hotel facilities are minimal. The rooftop garden is great for a little healing. 24-hour free parking is available. But the biggest advantage - being close to the airport bus  and subway station is the best advantage. And there\u0027s a large convenience store right next door. There\u0027s a delicious hamburger steak  restaurant across the street. There is a Neoguri Ramyun restaurant  right in front of Exit 9 of Myeongdong Station. You can eat the ramen you want  with the toppings you want. The staff will be there to assist you. Namsangol Hanok Village is about  an 8-minute walk from the hotel. Myeongdong is one subway stop away or about a 15-minute walk away. How about the stayrak hotel I recommended today?  Was it helpful?

It\u0027s a small restaurant with a pub atmosphere. The breakfast was cheap so there wasn\u0027t much variety. There is a high chair for babies. However, there is no baby bowl. Cheonggyecheon is a 3-minute walk from the hotel. It\u0027s also perfect for walking around at night. HIKR Ground is a 4-minute walk from the hotel. It has a total of 5 floors.

There is a BBQ chicken restaurant  right next to Cheonggyecheon. It may be a little spicy for foreigners,  so ask the staff to recommend a less spicy menu.

It is convenient because it provides two card keys. I booked a deluxe twin room. It feels wider and cleaner than expected. There is clothing deodorizer and bathrobes, and a safe. There are slippers underneath. The best thing about this hotel in my opinion!! The toilet, bathtub, and Washbasin are all separate. I have a system that only has a separate toilet. I really liked it If you make a reservation by following the link I left below ⬇️ You can reserve at a low price. For standard double room on weekdays You can reserve for $80, If you get closer to your schedule, you can do it for just $50! The refrigerator is a bit small.

The bathtub looks smaller than I thought Loah\u0027s mom went in and tried it herself. Ha Ha ha ha Ha There was no foreign matter or dust on the bed. It\u0027s very neat We like things to be neat.

In the direction of exit 5 of Gongdeok subway station There are many restaurants that Koreans often go to. Among them, today we are planning to visit  a restaurant with Pigs trotters. It takes about 10 minutes from the hotel. At exits 2 and 5 There is an elevator 아 여기 엘리베이터 있구나 Most restaurants in this direction are They are all famous. There are many similar restaurants. We go into the alley on the left here. We enter the restaurant on the left today. The menu to eat today is Pigs trotters. Small size for 2-3 people For 4 to 6 people, order large size. Small size is 34,000 won. Large size is 40,000 won. It\u0027s okay because Asian people have similar tastes. People in Europe or the United States can think of Schwein Haxen in Germany. The meat is tender and chewy. Even if it\u0027s not this restaurant Other nearby restaurants are also delicious. The soup in the middle is slightly spicy. The meat can be a little greasy It is also good to eat with alcohol or carbonated drinks. Loah begins a full-fledged hunt Even babies as young as 21 months eat well. Right next to Exit 8 nearby. There is a large Korean supermarket. It is convenient to use. There is Wine \u0026 More across from the accommodation. This is a chain store that sells a variety of alcoholic beverages at reasonable prices. I think it would be good to use it  when you want to cheer up. It\u0027s a safe location even if you walk around late at night. Actually, anywhere in Korea is safe even at night. We show you moving around with a stroller. I think you can think of it similarly to your suitcase. When you go down to the second floor You can eat breakfast from 7:30 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. Please refer to the withloah.com  website for detailed menus. We ordered menus 1 and 2. Unfortunately, it is not a buffet style. But privately among the group You can eat in your room as if you were being treated well. It is 19,000 won per person. The atmosphere and taste are good for the price. The food I ordered was meat soup. Loah\u0027s mom orders seaweed soup You can eat authentic Korean food. My food is a healthy combination of rich beef broth and rice. Loah\u0027s mother\u0027s food is soup with the smell of the sea. You can enjoy the morning city view while eating. Even if you don’t order baby food separately, Baby spoons, forks, cups and bowls are provided. There is also a baby chair. The soup is very thick. There is also abalone!! Unfortunately, I don’t think there is any vegan food. The child\u0027s cup is made of silicone,  so there is no need to worry about it breaking. Check-out was also done on our own."}
{"video_id":"4cCQa_daRCw","lang":"en","full_text":"Let\u0027s compare two places: Orakai Suites in Jongno and UH Flat the Seocho in Gangnam. The first hotel is Orakai Suites, located in the heart of Seoul. The hotel is about an 8-minute walk from Anguk Station or Jongno 5-ga Station on Line 3. It is located on Insadong Main Street, making it ideal for sightseeing. The rate is $200 per night for 3 people, including breakfast. This is a residence type with two bedrooms. The first impression of the room is classic. The kitchen was very clean and fully equipped. None of the hotels featured in the video were sponsored by the hotel. All were booked directly. This room is perfect for families as it is equipped with an oven, microwave, and dishwasher. And it was much cleaner than I expected. The second room has a queen size bed. There is a master bedroom inside. There is a king size bed. The bedding quality is mid-to-high level. The view is a general city view. The master bedroom bathroom has a bathtub. There is a separate shower room. The bathtub was a good size and very well cleaned. There is a washing machine and a drying rack in the second bathroom. However, there is no detergent. For more information, please refer to the description below⬇️ or the pinned comment. A gym and a kids\u0027 room are available. It was nice that there was a main pool, auxiliary pool, and jacuzzi. Breakfast has a limited variety. But the taste was okay. I don\u0027t want to go out because it\u0027s annoying in the morning = Recommended Be active from the morning = Not recommended When you leave the hotel, you are right on Insadong\u0027s main street. There are many delicious restaurants and cafes around. The second is a residence hotel located south of Seoul. It is close to the Express Bus Terminal Shopping Center, COEX, and Lotte World. It takes about 9 minutes on foot from Nambu Terminal Station on Line 3 to the hotel. None of the hotels featured in the video were sponsored by the hotel. All were booked directly. So I can review it objectively. The room rate is a little over $100 per night for four people. You must take off your shoes to enter this place. It feels very clean from the first impression. The bathroom is a little smaller than I thought, but it is very clean. This place feels more like visiting a friend\u0027s house than a hotel. $100 is a very reasonable price for this quality in Gangnam. The kitchen facilities are very clean and well organized. It was nice to use it because it also had laundry detergent. Honestly, the view was a little disappointing. But I am satisfied with the other facilities. The room has a queen size bed. The quality is mid-to-high level. I was able to sleep comfortably For more information, please refer to the description below⬇️ or the pinned comment. It had a lot of storage space, just like a real home, and there was even a styler. There is a double mattress in the living room, so it can accommodate up to 4 people. There is a convenience store outside, and a large mart 5 minutes away. The mart is bigger than I thought. Actually, I had no problem cooking it at all. There are no famous tourist attractions around the hotel, but there are many restaurants and convenience stores. If you take the subway two stops, you will find the famous Express Bus Terminal Shopping Center. It is connected to a department store. If you go to the right, you will find COEX Mall and Lotte World. Please subscribe and like so that I can reward you with better videos. Thank you."}

Third method - using the high-speed Arex train. You can get from the airport to Seoul Station in just 50 minutes by high-speed train.

I\u0027ll put a direct link in the description box below⬇️ or in the comments We do not advertise for money from hotels. We book directly and express ourselves honestly. It was convenient because the six elevators moved very quickly. We were assigned room 1430 The first impression of the room is casual and bright! As soon as you enter the room, there are three bathrobes, a safe, an iron, and three disposable slippers on the left. Indoor shoes are made of sturdy material with a moderate thickness. There is a Nespresso capsule coffee machine right next to it, 3 bottles of water, and 3 crackers. All free In the drawer, there are 2 wine glasses, 2 glasses, 2 coffee capsules, 2 mugs, 3 rooibos teas, 3 earl grey teas, 1 cocoa, and a wine opener. There are 3 bottles of water, juice, cola, cider, and soda in the refrigerator, and they are all free. First impression of the bathroom: small but clean! There are 3 shower towels and 3 face towels. It was very clean There is hand wash and body lotion. Starting in April 2024, Korean hotels will no longer provide toothbrushes and toothpaste due to restrictions on disposable items. The bathroom is small, but has a bidet. The bathroom was equipped with basic amenities. The bathtub is fine in width, but I think it\u0027s a little short in length. The room was newly renovated and very clean. On the left is a queen-size bed, and on the right is a single bed. You can see a lot of Voco\u0027s trademark colors, yellow and blue. I didn\u0027t have high expectations, but it was not only clean, I actually felt so refreshed when I woke up. I asked the hotel about the brand of bed. They say it\u0027s a Simmons product manufactured in-house by the hotel. But there was one thing that was disappointing.  There was no crib guard for infants. The next morning I was so refreshed that I talked to my family. The feeling of being wrapped around my body was amazing. Personally I don\u0027t like fabric, but this place was very clean. The view from Seoul Tower was really beautiful. However, it looks small in the video, which is a shame.  In reality, it looks much bigger. There was a Britz Bluetooth speaker alarm clock on the table, and there were various charging terminals. The TV wasn\u0027t a smart TV The downside is that there are no outlets around the bed and partial lighting control is not available. There is a convenience store behind the elevator, so it is very convenient. There is a large cafe next to the elevator. There is a Burger King next to the large cafe. There was a restaurant on the second floor. There is a fitness center and swimming pool on the 3rd floor. The gym is open 24 hours a day. The space was a bit small, but the equipment was very clean. The swimming pool is open from 6am to 10pm. It\u0027s a shame that the lockers don\u0027t have locks. It had a small jacuzzi so it was great for little ones to play in. I think the water temperature is around 32 degrees. I didn\u0027t know that large tubes and beach balls were prohibited. Fortunately, it was before closing time so there was no one there, and the person in charge was understanding. There is a club lounge on the 18th floor. I thought the door was closed hahahaha After checking the room number, you can sit where you want. I like it so much, the atmosphere is so good I was able to eat light chocolate and cookies. Juice, soft drinks, coffee and tea are also available. The dessert was average. The coffee was delicious. But the view is still so beautiful. Oh!! But there\u0027s a twist Happy hour is from 5:30 PM to 8 PM! The taste of the food and the atmosphere are so good The quality of the food was higher than I expected. I was planning to eat a moderate amount here and then go out to eat, but the food here was so delicious that I ended up eating here. I was very satisfied with the lounge at the Voco Hotel. Open from 6:30 am to 10:30 am. Because there are many foreign guests, the menu features Korean bibimbap. Unfortunately, the bread is a bit disappointing. The tea was so delicious There wasn\u0027t a lot of food variety, but the taste was okay! Strangely enough, there were three types of bacon. Baby bowls and forks were also provided, and the surrounding atmosphere was nice. You can see Seoulro 7017 on the left side of the hotel. It took about a minute from the hotel to here. You can walk to Seoul Station. You can see the view of Seoul along the way. It took about 10 minutes to get here. Across from the hotel is Namdaemun Market. It took about 3 minutes to get here. From here, it is a children\u0027s clothing wholesale market. This place and the Poki Wholesale Market are popular. It\u0027s a great place to buy gifts for people around you. The price is cheap but the quality is good. The price ranges from 5,000 to 10,000 won per piece. It\u0027s fun to browse the market because there are so many different foods. This is in front of Exit 5 of Hoehyeon Station across from the hotel. The fruits here are cheap and delicious. To the right of the hotel are Myeongdong and Shinsegae Department Store. From Exit 1 of Hoehyeon Station, cross the street to Shinsegae Department Store. Go straight ahead. It took about 10 minutes from the hotel to here. Admission is free. Closed on Mondays. There is a lot to see here, from Korean currency to foreign currency. It\u0027s fun for everyone from children to adults. It\u0027s so big that I think you\u0027ll probably be able to see it in about 2~3 hours. Loah mom is playing a prank hahahaha There are many different and interesting programs. From November to January, you can enjoy media art every night at Exit 1 of the Hoehyeon Underground Shopping Center."}
{"video_id":"fANzTKMO1gI","lang":"en","full_text":"Today, I\u0027m going to share some great family-friendly hotels in Seoul. I recommend staying in central Seoul. The first hotel is the Voco Hotel, which is close to Namdaemun Market. There are many tourist attractions within walking distance. The hotel is a 20-second walk from Exit 3 of Hoehyeon Station on Subway Line 4. There is an airport bus stop right in front of the hotel. The rate for a family of three is in the mid-$200s per night. This room has one single bed and one queen-size bed. My first impression was that it was bright and clean. The bathroom was small but very convenient and clean. The bathtub was a little smaller than I thought. Since it had just opened, everything felt very clean. Cons: No outlets near the bed, and some lights couldn’t be turned off. However, the bed quality is good. The mattress and blanket were both super comfortable. The view of Seoul Tower was really nice. Unfortunately, Seoul Tower looks quite small on camera. I don\u0027t like the fabric of the sofa, but this place was very clean. There are multiple charging ports on the desk. There is a fitness center and swimming pool on the 3rd floor of the hotel. The facilities are also very clean. The pool was small, but convenient to use. There is a club lounge on the 18th floor. The view of Seoul Tower was very nice, and the lounge atmosphere was also nice. During the day, you can enjoy simple drinks and desserts such as chocolate and cookies. However, the menu and atmosphere changed completely during dinner time, so we were really satisfied. We recommend including lounge access when making your reservation. There is a restaurant on the second floor. There are not many kinds, but the taste was good. All of our videos are not paid advertisements. We booked them ourselves. The restaurant has a casual atmosphere and the tables are spaced widely apart. Most of the famous tourist attractions are within walking distance. Across the street from the hotel is Namdaemun Market. You can find children\u0027s clothing wholesalers and a variety of food. For more information, please refer to the description below⬇️ or the pinned comment. The second hotel is one with very convenient transportation. You can reach famous tourist attractions within 20 minutes by public transportation. The hotel is located 10 seconds away from the exit of Chungmuro ​​Station. The airport bus stop is right in front of the hotel, so it\u0027s very convenient. The hotel lobby is very casual. Rooms that sleep up to six people start at around $200 per night. I\u0027ll show you a 6-person room with 3 double beds. All of our videos are not paid advertisements. We booked them ourselves. It\u0027s a real treat to be able to stay in such a large room in downtown Seoul for $200. The facilities also used high-end equipment. I was really surprised by the large spa facilities. The bed quality is mid to high. There are two each of TV, sofa, refrigerator, and bathroom. There are three double beds in total. We have a young child so we check the beds very carefully. The view of Seoul Tower is very beautiful. The bathroom on the other side is also very luxurious. It has a beautiful bathtub. Hanok Village and Myeongdong are a 10-minute walk away. I highly recommend Namsangol Hanok Village. I don\u0027t recommend Mondays. Myeongdong is a 10-minute walk away, making it ideal for shopping and sightseeing. The third hotel is located in Gwanghwamun. There are so many tourist attractions within walking distance from the hotel. It takes about 5 minutes to walk from Gwanghwamun Station on Line 5 to the hotel. There is an airport bus stop right in front of the hotel. The \"Glocaloca\" hotel occupies two floors, the 19th and 20th floors of the Koreana Hotel. Very reasonable rates, starting at around $100 per night for 4 people. Today we\u0027re introducing a room with two queen-size beds. All of our videos are not paid advertisements. We booked them ourselves. The bathroom is plain and clean. Most Korean hotels these days do not provide disposable toothbrushes. But this place does. For more information, please refer to the description below⬇️ or the pinned comment. It was nice to be able to see the entire Gwanghwamun area. However, if there is a rally, you may hear some noise. The bed quality is average. We have a baby so we check the bed very carefully. Overall, I liked the room as it was large for the price. There\u0027s a real twist! The shared kitchen is so clean and nice. You can eat as much cereal, coffee, cocoa, ramen, etc. as you like. You can use the washing machine and detergent for free. The shared office is also a really great space. Personally, I like shared service better than rooms. Hahahaha Both Deoksugung and Gyeongbokgung Palaces are within walking distance. Across from the hotel is Cheonggyecheon. Gwanghwamun Square is a 9-minute walk away. For more information, please refer to the description below⬇️ or the pinned comment. The last hotel is a residence-style hotel in Insa-dong. Here too, there are famous tourist attractions within 20 minutes by public transportation. It takes about 8 minutes from Anguk Station or Jongno 5-ga Station on Line 3 to the hotel. The airport bus stop is also near the subway station. It is located on Insadong Main Street, so the location is very good. The rate is around $200 for 3 people, including breakfast. The room type I’m showing you today is a two-bedroom. The first impression is that it feels classic. The kitchen facilities are truly perfect. All the hotels in the video were not paid by the hotel. I booked and used them all directly. This is a great room type for families with children like us to stay in. It\u0027s really clean. For more information, please refer to the description below⬇️ or the pinned comment. The second room has a queen size bed. The bed quality is mid-to-high level. It is very clean.

The bathtub was of average size, and the tub was also clean. The second bathroom has a washer and dryer. However, there was no detergent. For more information, please refer to the description below⬇️ or the pinned comment. The fitness center is also well maintained. There was a kids room, but I was satisfied with just having it. There is a large main pool, a smaller pool, and a jacuzzi. Breakfast was okay, but there was very little variety. If you don\u0027t feel like eating outside in the morning = Recommended The hotel is located on Insadong Street, making it ideal for sightseeing. There are many famous restaurants and cafes around. Please subscribe and like so that I can reward you with better videos. Thank you."}
{"video_id":"L25auXlu02A","lang":"en","full_text":"The hotel looks like the Palace of Versailles The rooms also have a palace-like feel. There is an airport bus stop in front of the hotel! There are some great restaurants nearby! There is also a Hyundai Motor Company showroom around the hotel. Let\u0027s go together with \"Loah\" today! Come to Exit 1 of Hakdong Station on Subway Line 7. Go straight ahead. It took about 5 minutes to get here. After crossing the crosswalk, immediately turn right. It takes about 8 minutes to walk to the hotel. The airport bus stop is right in front of the hotel. It takes about 2 hours from the airport to the hotel. For more information, please refer to the description below⬇️ or the comments. The hotel is very fancy and pretty. There is a cafe in the front. On the right are the reception and breakfast room. Each platform has slightly different options and rates. I used Agoda. Please refer to the description or comments below⬇️ I chose the deluxe double room. The elevator is not a card touch system. I was assigned to the 14th floor. This is not a sponsorship. I paid for this 100% myself. To the right are a coat rack and a shoe rack. The shoe rack is also pretty. There is a piece of furniture that looks like a dressing table right next to it. And there are bathrobes, a safe, and disposable slippers. The slippers are quite thick. The bathroom is much prettier than I expected. Two shower towels, two small towels, and one foot towel are provided. The bathroom products are from \"Kohler\" and the bathtub is narrow and deep. Body lotion, shower gel, and shampoo are Penhaligon\u0027s products. Disposable products will be banned in Korea starting in April 2024. Disposable toothbrushes and toothpaste will not be provided. The remaining products are provided in a luxurious manner. The bidet and shower booth are well separated. We have Penhaligon\u0027s products. The shower room is very clean. A disadvantage is that water splashes outside the shower stall, making the sink floor slippery. On the right side of the room is a fancy minibar. Two basic coffee capsules, two tea bags, and two bottles of water are free. The quality of the two capsules and tea bags provided is good. Not bad for the price of a 5 star hotel. The TV is a smart TV. It plays YouTube and Netflix well. It is large compared to the room. There is a humidifier that was requested in advance. The table and stand are very classic. I was confused because the outlet was in the table drawer. The room design is very European and antique. However, the view from the room is a bit disappointing. We requested a king bed room for 2 adults and 1 infant. The bed condition was excellent. It was soft and smelled good. It\u0027s very fluffy. I requested a crib guard in advance. Fortunately, the bed size is bigger than I thought. I think we\u0027ll need to add a bed later when \"Loah\" gets a little bigger. Luckily, it was a super king size, which is slightly larger than a regular king size. The room was smaller than I thought, but I am satisfied because it is so pretty. If you are looking for this level of quality and value for money in Gangnam, Seoul, this is the place. Here are the temperature controller and outlet locations. It feels like you\u0027re in a luxury French hotel. The door is thick. You can\u0027t hear any outside noise at all. There is a cafe in the lobby. There are many old-fashioned antiques everywhere. There is a breakfast room and a nursing room. Further inside are a tailor shop and a bar. Every part of the hotel looks like a photo spot. There is a Japanese restaurant on the right side of the second floor. The view from the 2nd floor looking down on the 1st floor lobby is even better than the room view. Hahahaha On the left is a Chinese restaurant. Seriously, everywhere is a photo spot. The second basement floor has a fitness center and a barber shop. No entry for those under 16, No entry for those with excessive tattoos Originally, they said we shouldn\u0027t film, but I made a special request. The swimming pool and gym are available to general guests. Sauna is available for a fee. It was so well managed that it felt like looking into another underground world. The breakfast restaurant is located on the first floor. Open from 6:30 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. Adults 65,000 won, children under 13 years old 32,500 won. Children under 48 months old are free. Guests receive a 20% discount. If you compare different platforms in the description box below⬇️ or in the comments, there may be an option that includes breakfast. Personally, I really liked the friendliness of the staff and the atmosphere of the restaurant. However, the dish was not as satisfying as I thought. Maybe it\u0027s because I\u0027m a bit picky. The bakery items were a little disappointing. Overall, most of the food tastes average. I think they probably used frozen dough. It\u0027s a shame that baby cutlery is a breakable item. Just go straight on the road to the right of the hotel for 5 minutes. I recommend \"Cheong Wa Ok\". I recommend \"Sundae Guk\" Regular 10,000 won Extra large 11,000 won We ordered 2 extra large bowls. It\u0027s a soup full of pork. \"Loah\" is also very tasty. If you walk about 8 minutes further down the road to the right of the restaurant, you will see the Hyundai Motor Company exhibition hall. Admission is free. Open until 9pm. If you are interested in cars, I highly recommend it. The first floor is a concept exhibition. The second and third floors are the history of Hyundai Motor Company. The fourth and fifth floors are where you can ride SUVs and electric vehicles. On the third floor, old Hyundai cars were on display. On the 4th floor, you can view and ride SUV vehicles. Coffee is served on the 4th and 5th floors. I recommend the Express Bus Terminal Station, which is 3 stops away from Hakdong Station on Line 7. It is connected to the subway station, so it is not affected by the outside weather. There are many things to see and eat. There is a concept exhibition on the first floor. I also recommend the \"Famille Station\" mall next door. I also recommend COEX, which is 30 minutes away from the hotel by bus or subway. There are lots of things to see, eat, and do. If you come in November or December, you can also see the Hyundai Department Store Christmas event."}
{"video_id":"OhzrL537I3w","lang":"en","full_text":"Our family makes reservations directly and expresses themselves honestly. First method - the airport bus right in front of the hotel! Second method - Exit 3 of Hoehyeon Station on Subway Line 4 There\u0027s an elevator right behind, so it\u0027s okay to carry heavy luggage. It is a 1-minute walk from the exit to the hotel. Third method - using the high-speed Arex train. You can get from the airport to Seoul Station in just 50 minutes by high-speed train. From here, it takes about 10 minutes to walk along Seoul 7017 Street to the hotel. The hotel lobby has a casual and warm atmosphere. The staff were very friendly and welcoming. Check-in 3pm Check-out 12pm Depending on the situation, it is possible to check in a little earlier. Rates vary slightly from site to site.

It was convenient because the six elevators moved very quickly. Today I will show you Seoul King Suite Room 2036! The first impression of the room was that it was very bright and casual, and the view was great! There is a king size bed on the right. The view from the bed is amazing. In reality, Seoul Tower is very large, but it appears small in the video. I loved the feeling of the bed wrapping around my body. I liked it so I asked the hotel about it and they said it was a Simmons product made by the hotel itself. Next to the bedroom, there are four bathrobes, four disposable slippers, an iron, and a safe. Each booth has a separate bidet and shower. The view from the bathtub is also the same as the Seoul Tower view. The drainage system is well-maintained around the bathtub. There are two sinks and plenty of towels. Disposable products will be restricted in Korea from April 2024, so toothbrushes and toothpaste will not be provided. The atmosphere is really the best!! \"Loah\" keeps asking me to go to the pool~ hahaha There are various chargers prepared on the round table. The TV wasn\u0027t a smart TV.  It\u0027s a shame there was only one bed. “Voco”’s unique colors stand out. You can see the hotel parking lot! The blackout curtains were really great! The fridge was huge!  All the drinks inside were free. There are 8 bottles in total, 4 bottles of water in the refrigerator and 4 bottles next to the coffee machine. There was a small sink, but no special cooking utensils. \"Loah\" keeps whining about going to the pool. It was really nice because there was no noise at all, the view was good, and it was clean. There\u0027s one more bathroom! There is only a bidet and a sink here. It\u0027s a shame there\u0027s no TV in the living room, but~ The atmosphere is good and it\u0027s clean, so I\u0027m really satisfied.

I will show you 3 places in the center of Gwanghwamun and Myeongdong and 1 place in Gangnam. The first hotel is the conveniently located \"Stayrak\" hotel. The hotel is located in the heart of famous landmarks. The hotel is located 10 seconds away from Chungmuro ​​Station on Subway Lines 3 and 4.

It feels like two rooms are connected. For more information, please refer to the description below⬇️ or the pinned comment. The bed was clean and of average to upper quality. I\u0027m checking more carefully because I have a child. The room view is a great view of Seoul Tower. The bathroom on the other side has similar facilities, but this one has a smaller bathtub. Cons: No hotel amenitie facilities. There is also no breakfast room. Hanok Village and Myeongdong are a 10-minute walk away.

The bed quality is average. But, it is not a problem. You\u0027ll be hard-pressed to find such a spacious room at such a reasonable price right in the heart of Seoul. I highly recommend the shared kitchen. You can eat as much ramen, cereal, milk, coffee, cocoa, etc. as you want. Washing machines and detergents are also available for free use. A shared office is also a great place to work. I feel like the public services are better than the guest rooms. Hahaha Deoksugung Palace is a 10-minute walk away. Across from the hotel is Cheonggyecheon. Most landmarks are within walking distance. It takes about 18 minutes to walk to Gyeongbokgung Palace. The third is a residence-type hotel that is great for sightseeing in Jongno and Anguk. The hotel is located on Insadong\u0027s main street, close to most of the famous tourist attractions. It takes about 7-8 minutes to get to the hotel from Anguk Station on Line 3 or Jongno 3-ga Station on Line 5. I am going from Anguk Station to the hotel. There is an airport bus stop near the subway station. The hotel is a 4-star residence-style hotel. The rate is $200 per night for 4 people, including breakfast.

There was also a swimming pool on the same floor, with a large main pool and two smaller pools. Breakfast was average. However, the variety was a bit limited. I don\u0027t recommend it, but it\u0027s not bad either. As soon as you leave the hotel, you will find Insadong\u0027s main street. You can experience trendy culture in Anguk. For more detailed information, please refer to the description below⬇️ or the pinned comments. The fourth hotel is a residence-style hotel located south of Seoul. Although it is away from Myeongdong and Gwanghwamun, it is in a good location for sightseeing, such as COEX and Express Bus Terminal Shopping Center. It takes about 9 minutes on foot from Nambu Terminal Station on Line 3 to the hotel. All hotels were booked and paid for directly without any sponsorship. There are no famous landmarks around the hotel. Transportation is not convenient either. However, if you want a clean and comfortable feeling like home, I recommend this place. It\u0027s a reasonable rate of $120 per night for 4 people. One queen size bed and individual mattress are provided. First impression is very clean. Please take off your shoes before entering.

This is the best hotel for travelers with children like us. The stylish and clean room has a queen-size bed. Because I have a child, I check more thoroughly. Cleanliness and quality are good. There is a dressing table, styler, and various storage spaces. We recommend this accommodation to families with children like us, or to travelers who want a more comfortable stay. There is a large supermarket a 5-minute walk away. The mart is bigger than I thought. For more information, please refer to the description below⬇️ or the pinned comment. There are many restaurants, cafes, and convenience stores around the hotel, so it is convenient. If you take the subway two stops, you will find the famous Express Bus Terminal Shopping Center. It is connected to a department store. If you move to the right, you can easily get to COEX and Lotte World. Please look forward to the next video. Thank you for watching. If you subscribe, you can see good information."}

It\u0027s a great view overlooking the city of Gwanghwamun. The room size is very large for the price in Seoul. The quality of the bed is not that high. It\u0027s not luxurious, but I\u0027m satisfied because it\u0027s a large room for the price and it\u0027s a 4-person room. The area surrounding the hotel is mostly landmarks.

And there is a mattress and blanket for two in the living room, so it is a room for four people in total. But the view outside the window is a bit disappointing. There are convenience stores and large marts very close by. It is a 5-minute walk away. The mart is very well-equipped and matches well with the residence. It was great to have a kitchen. There are many restaurants and cafes around the hotel. It is convenient to travel to nearby tourist attractions by subway. Two stops away is the famous Express Bus Terminal Shopping Center. If you go to the right, you will find Gangnam COEX and Lotte World. It\u0027s a shame that there are no famous tourist attractions around the hotel, but it\u0027s a hotel with clear pros and cons.

The toilet, shower room, and sink are all separate. The bathtub and washbasin are  high-end Italian products.

I personally like disposable slippers,  but I understand the environmental implications. The view is much nicer than I thought. You can see Seoul Tower well. The room condition is quite satisfactory overall.  It is well soundproofed and there is no smell. For a room of this quality in the heart of Seoul,  $80 per night is a really good deal.

{"video_id":"-MqTLKPIDZk","lang":"en","full_text":"64,000 won in a bowl of Imseonghan? 68,000 won. You will see in the video that the luxury bingsu of a 5-star hotel is more expensive than most meats. Who will be the winner of the Mang Bing between Shilla Hotel and Four Seasons Sotae? Let\u0027s find out together now what bingsu that Ttenam recommends will hit the summer. Hello, I am Ttenam again. When it comes to hotel bingsu, the first bingsu that comes to mind is E-Mang Bing of Mango Bingsu. Apple Mango Bingsu was first introduced in 2008 by Jeju Shilla Hotel in order to discover local ingredients, using plenty of Jeju apple mangoes. It was then expanded to Seoul Shilla Hotel in 2011, and it played a leading role in leading the luxury bingsu craze in Korea. Perhaps because of that historical background, when you think of E-Mang Bingsu, Shilla Hotel comes to mind first. This year, as always, The Library\u0027s apple mango bingsu has come to mention the hotel. However, the price is...  It\u0027s 64,000 won, which is 5,000 won more expensive than last year, but they are implementing a price linkage system, so the acquisition price has increased due to the higher price of apple mangoes. As famous as Mango Bingsu is, the N Wang Show, or Apple Mango Shortcake, which you can have for 23,000 won. You might say, \"How can such a small cake cost 23,000 won?\" But, Ware Pastry Boutique is selling an apple mango whole cake for 77,000 won, so you can think of it as a quarter of the price. It\u0027s a simple, cheat cream mango shortcake that doesn\u0027t look fancy on the outside, but it was really delicious when I took a bite. It\u0027s said that mango itself is very sweet, so I think they knew that and tried to balance it out. The whipped cream or sheet wasn\u0027t too much, so I was able to fully enjoy the sweetness of the mangoes. The apple mango bingsu, which is the main game, comes in a transparent plastic cover. They say it\u0027s to maintain the coolness and taste until the cable comes up. You can tell at a glance by looking at the square-shaped PC case.  It was topped with a generous amount of apple mango, and it was said that one bingsu would have two whole apple mangoes, one and a half. It was also unusual to see an ice cube on top of the mango. Handmade popsicles and mango sherbet were also served with the bingsu. The most important thing in bingsu is ice. This time, it seems they tried to balance it out with the mango, but the ice itself was not as sweet as I thought, but not too sweet. It was a milk ice that was not too sweet, but not too strong. Above all, the texture was not too heavy, and it was crunchy and refreshing, like sherbet. The mango looked sweet at first glance, but I knew it was low. Usually, mango bingsu is topped with mango syrup, but I was confident that I could do it without trying. Only pure mango pulp was served. When you eat half of the bingsu, you can see the mango inside. After eating all the mango flavor that you want on top, you can\u0027t find the mango flavor, so it seems to be dark to compensate for that. There is plenty of space towards the sea of ​​bingsu, so you can experience the miracle of the bingsu becoming sweeter the more you eat. I added red beans here and there, and added more mango sherbet.  I ate it and it wasn\u0027t too sweet and had a deep flavor, so it was delicious even if I just ate it with ice and a plate without mango. For your information, Shilla Hotel\u0027s mango bing is the real original, you can get it at the Shilla Hotel in Jeju. The composition is the same, but the way the mango is cut is different and the price is a little different, so please keep that in mind. Shilla Hotel has a mango bingsu that has issued a challenge. Come right away. It is an apple mango bingsu on the floor of the lobby lounge of Ho Season 3 Saul, which is considered the best hotel in Korea along with Lotte. The Four Seasons\u0027 mango bingsu, which was sold for 49,000 won until last year, was reborn as the highest bingsu at 68,000 won this year, raising the price to a whopping 9,000 won. It is said that the price was adjusted starting this year because they use the highest quality Jeju apple mango, but the prices of the other bingsu that do not use apples have also increased significantly at the same time. The mango bingsu at Four Seasons Hotel is different from Shilla Hotel\u0027s in that it is made by cutting the mango long and covering it with ice.  It\u0027s different from the mango bingsu. You can tell just by looking at it that there are two large apple mangoes topped with apple mint. Next to the mango condensed milk and mango ice cream 2 are served together, and underneath the ice cream is a coconut chrome grill. You have to eat the mango first to taste the ice, but I ate the Hilau Tega Sauce Sense bingsu at the same time to make an accurate comparison. As a result, when comparing the mangoes, the mango at the Four Seasons 3 Hotel was sweeter. Even though I went to the Four Seasons later, it felt sweeter, so it seems that on this day, the Four Seasons Ae mango was sweeter than the Shilla mango. There was ice inside the mango that was exposed, and it was milk ice. If the Shilla Hotel ice was a bit larger and had a sharp feeling like sherbet, the Four Seasons Hotel\u0027s ice was a bit finer and had the snowflake ice that we are familiar with. Personally, I liked the texture of the Shin Make bingsu because it was crunchier and refreshing. After eating a bit more ice, the mango ice cream came out right away. There was also the mango ice cream 2 that came with the bingsu, even without the bingsu.  I even sprinkled some extra mango on the shaved ice and ate it. It was unique that there was an advertising prawn at the bottom to bring out the mango flavor to the end. So, which one is tastier, the Shilla Hotel Seoul or the Four Seasons Seoul\u0027s Aemang Bingsu? Personally, I think it\u0027s the perfect Shilla Hotel mango bingsu. It\u0027s delicious, but the amount is too much to make a full bingsu, and the mango is sweet, so you might get tired of it. The Shilla Hotel\u0027s mango bingsu has ice on top of the mango, so you can taste just the ice at first, or you can put the mango on top, and if you get tired of it, you can mix it into the pot and eat it. The mango puree that comes out in the middle and the condensed milk underneath have another rich mango flavor, so you can finish the full bingsu without getting tired of it. After eating it, I can understand to some extent why people line up for it even on weekday lunches. The mango itself in the Four Seasons\u0027 mango bingsu was delicious, but the mango holiday mango ice cream and mango pudding were too mango-y, and I ended up leaving a little bit left at the end.  It\u0027s not like bingsu costs 1 million won per ml. Besides, there may be people who don\u0027t like mango. Let\u0027s take a look at what bingsu from 5-star hotels are recommended when leaving, other than mango bingsu. First, the highest place in Korea where consumers are tempted to eat bingsu, Jamsil Lotte Tower, is better than the 79th floor of Seoul. Personally, I like Hawaiian pizza the best, and I\u0027m a pineapple lover who eats pineapple trapped in it while grilling meat, so I couldn\u0027t miss out on Rem 1 Pop. In addition to the milk 8-level bingsu, Coco also sells Mansu bingsu and melon vanilla bingsu. The shockingly visual bingsu has finally arrived. The Gap-o drinks remind me of Roman gladiators. It was so strong. Coconut, my kimchi, nuts, and other ingredients are served together with the bingsu. When I carefully removed the lid, the bingsu with Shinan pineapple on top was revealed. On top of the file f, finely chopped apple mint was added.  It\u0027s cut and stacked. The recent 2 bar beanie ice is also made with frozen yogurt, so the ice itself is sweet and delicious, and the texture is crunchy, which is good. Hotel Pineapple, in particular, is good. The pineapple is really sweet, so you don\u0027t have to worry about it. The pineapple is endlessly sweet, and the coconut milk makes it even more flavorful and luxurious. The apple mint scent was also good. The pineapple is densely packed at the bottom of the shaved ice, so you can keep eating until you\u0027re done. You can add nut rice cakes to taste according to your taste. The nuts are caramelized, so they\u0027re a bit too sweet, so I didn\u0027t eat a lot. Personally, I recommend this drink to those who like pineapple. However, the amount is too small. I came across the expensive mango shaved ice earlier, and it looks relatively cheap at 52,000 won, but you shouldn\u0027t forget that this is shaved ice. The second shaved ice I\u0027m going to introduce is the Forest Ing Watermelon Bingsu at the Westin Chosun Seoul. They sell three types of shaved ice at the lounge bar in the hotel lobby: Kal Bing, Mang Bing, and Su Bing. Who said that?  No matter what they say, the Westin Chosun Seoul is a Subic restaurant. In fact, it\u0027s true that my expectations for watermelon bingsu weren\u0027t high. That\u0027s because it\u0027s a drink that we can imagine what it tastes like without even trying it. But when I actually imagine it, my mouth waters. If you\u0027re curious about the new drink, please subscribe and like it. A bingsu that looks cute enough to look like watermelon bingsu appears. The ice is made by grinding watermelon, freezing it, and then regrind it, so it\u0027s truly watermelon ice. The watermelon is cut into circles like the lower body, and the juice is sprinkled on top. You might wonder if it\u0027s necessary to include watermelon seeds, but they\u0027re not harvested, but sunflower seeds. The outside is coated with chocolate, so you can drink it with confidence. The taste of the drink is just as I imagined, but the watermelon ice is a little tastier than I imagined. It\u0027s sweet, but it\u0027s not unpleasant, and it goes down smoothly. The watermelon flesh is less sweet, so eating it together feels balanced. And the watermelon\u0027s fruity nature is definitely very refreshing. When it\u0027s hot, it\u0027s definitely refreshing.  I think it would be really good if you tried it. I went there twice because it was so refreshing and delicious, and I had a king bingsu both times without fail. I have two sizes, you and small, so don\u0027t hesitate and get the Olle-gil you. The price is 38,000 won, which is 2,000 won more than last year, but if you join the Marriott Burn Boy, which anyone can join, you can get a 10% discount and get it for 34,200 won. Next is the Huh Wool Bing Honey Gold Bingsu at The Lounge, located on the 4th floor of Park Hae-t Seoul Isha. The Lounge, which is also a great viewpoint where you can see COEX at a glance, has 5 bingsu menus. Among them, the most representative signature bingsu is the Honey Bold Bingsu, which is characterized by a whole piece of Wolak Mountain honey coated with gold leaf on finely ground melk ice. It is topped with church apple puree, whipped cream, chocolate chips reminiscent of traditional patterns, and roasted pecans. I remember having milk ice cream that was pulled up in a honeycomb shape at that time.  It tastes like ice cream. It\u0027s not too sweet even though you need tea, and it goes well with the 12-ounce milk ice cream. Park Hyatt Seoul in particular has a wide variety of shaved ice and even offers a shaved ice combination that lets you enjoy two shaved ices at once, so it\u0027s good to check it out. The fourth one I recommend to those who like retro sensibilities is the retro shooting water at the lobby lounge and bar on the first floor of the Grand InterContinental Seoul Parnas. It\u0027s topped with fine snowflake shaved ice made from frozen milk, field and mugwort ice cream, and lotus leaf rice cake. I thought the watermelon-colored cube in front of the injeolmi was just rice cake, but it was actually raw mugwort chocolate. It\u0027s usually topped with sweet frosting, but I asked them to take it out separately. Lastly, they give you six kinds of mugwort leaves to sprinkle on the shaved ice. I like mugwort, so I grew up with it, but the crane was delicious, and the ice cream topping force is just right. In particular, the forest itself has a bitter taste, so I think it balances well with the sweet dessert, but the sweet combination is good. However, I wish the injeolmi was a little softer.  It was a bit simple, which was a shame, and the mugwort raw chocolate tasted a bit better than I expected. But overall, it was good, and as always, the atmosphere was good, and I wanted to go there with my mother. Each bingsu is also sold in a 1-size, and if you sign up for IHG membership here, you can get a 15% discount, so please keep that in mind. Today\u0027s bingsu competition is the last one, the cheese bingsu at Conrad Seoul 37 Grill \u0026 Bar in Yeouido. This place has a particularly great view of the Han River from Yeouido, and if you order bingsu, you can enjoy it at the bar. The cheese bingsu that was released this year is characterized by a total of three types of cheese on top of the bingsu: cream cheese, from aju cheese, and parmesan cheese. Above all, I think this is the bingsu that has captured the SNS sensibility the most. It\u0027s amazing from the moment it appears. Dry ice is placed under the plate to lower the temperature, and it looks good and is the best visual that is good to post on SNS. The thing that is placed like a bang on top is made by frying Parmesan cheese.  It\u0027s sprinkled all the way to the top. The ice here is made from shaved ice with cheese and milk, but it was a bit bland than I thought. I was expecting a thick, sweet taste like New York cheesecake, but the ice is so bland that I wondered if it was really milk ice. Instead, it has blueberry compote and fromage cheese inside, which adds sweetness and vegetable flavor. The Parmesan cheesecake on top was slightly salty and had a unique cheese flavor. The visual of the wandering was almost top-notch, but the taste was a bit disappointing. I got Tibing. So far, we\u0027ve looked at the luxury bingsu of the success and failure portals that have helped us beat the summer heat. There\u0027s also a video reviewing the afternoon teas of 5-star hotels, so if you\u0027re interested, please refer to it.

{"video_id":"iJTZfFQtLSs","lang":"en","full_text":"Even in Gangnam, there is a rich neighborhood called Apgujeong, and the lyrics in the song \" Tanote\" are one of them. Andaji Seoul Gangnam is evaluated to have established the traditional color of Korea. Is it really worth going? Today, I will tell you about [Music] Hello, this is the man who left again, and today is kk. In the past, Korea Telecom operated numerous telephone companies across the country. As times changed, the need for telephone company operations decreased, and KT entered the total telecommunications business utilizing the site of the telephone company. Today, I will introduce you to Nandaji Seoul, which opened in September 2019 by developing the existing Shinsa Jeonhak office. As it is located in Apgujeong, the center of wealth in Korea, it has emerged as a trendy password that makes the existing telephone company completely unforgettable. First of all, Andaji is a very hot hotel brand by the local government. In Hindi, it means personal style. Andaji is a brand operated by the global hotel chain, Haet, which started from Under and is the fourth in Asia to land in Gangnam, Seoul. In [ __ ], it is a parka. This year\u0027s hotel is in the same category as Busan. The hotel\u0027s operation is entrusted to HDC Hotel, which also owns Park Hyatt Seoul and Busan. It\u0027s located right in front of Exit 3 of Apgujeong Station, making you wonder if it really needs to be this close to the subway station. Upon entering the lobby, you arrive at the Andaji reception, which features a stylish staircase that is a symbol of Andaji. While not a large space, it has been decorated with a modern feel, reflecting Andaji\u0027s youthful sensibility. It\u0027s especially warm without the Christmas tree decorations installed all over the place. To the side, interesting contemporary art is on display. But what impressed me most was the celadon-shaped sculpture next to the elevator leading to the guest rooms. A closer look reveals the Korean consonants in a single layer. This unique blend of Andaji\u0027s signature sophisticated youthful nightlife and traditional Korean Miyagi cuisine is a defining characteristic. On one side of the lobby is the front desk where check-in takes place. It feels like an Arch Club concierge, reminiscent of Evita. The boutiques and boutiques of Andaji Seoul stand out. Andaji Seoul already has rooms that are worth a visit.  We have c200 16:00 and six types of suites 25:00. Among them, shall we take a look at the room I stayed in, the 1616 9 Deluxe Room first? If you enter thinking of a regular hotel room, you will get a different feeling at first glance. There are many reasons, but the design of the room wall with the TV on top is really cool. The design by Fai TV Studio, a design team representing the Netherlands, is said to have been inspired by Korean patchwork. It is really refreshing to see the flat pieces of the frame divided like a traditional patchwork and the arrangement of the TV and picture decorations. Not only that, the storage space on the left was also inspired by Korean small things, which is extraordinary. In fact, Anda G\u0027s brand philosophy is that the place you stay should provide a unique sensibility of that region. You can see that the Korean style is incorporated into the room space as well. The colors used throughout the room are also themed with celadon blue, green, and new yellow, which are not colors you often see in room interiors, creating a unique atmosphere. Those with a keen eye may have already noticed, but the room is rectangular.  The bedroom and bathroom have diagonal walls. In terms of space utilization, using diagonal walls is not an easy choice. It can feel unfamiliar to us who are used to straight spaces. Fortunately, the Deluxe Room itself is 48 square meters, much more spacious than a typical 5-star hotel room in Seoul, so the space does not feel cramped. There is a red table at the entrance, and a king-sized bed is placed beyond the bed. Unlike typical hotels, the bed does not have a headboard, but is decorated with LED lights for a unique look. As expected from a hotel operated by KT, Giga Genie serves as the controller, and a sofa is placed next to it, matching the color of the table. It has a two-way view of both the East and the West. To the west is the view of the rainy Apgujeong Hyundai Department Store and Namsan in the distance, and to the east is the view of the 505 Street, about 9 points away. As you can see, Andaji Seoul\u0027s biggest weakness is the view. There is no distinctive view from either direction, east or west. Beyond the diagonal wall is the bathroom. The room is made of parquet flooring.  I hate the bathroom, but there\u0027s a separate table for the competition if you wash in one room. Of course, there\u0027s also a bathtub. The shower booth is at the end where the wall is the narrowest. Next to the window, there\u0027s a large, dotted decoration made of a material that adds to the sensibility. And you can speak Tamil. The nose in this bathroom is so huge that singing while showering makes you feel like a singer. [Music] The amenities are provided by Tang Drift Bud No. 3 13, a collaboration between Raph Taggar and master perfumer Pesto Plot Amiel. It\u0027s a product that\u0027s hard to find in hotels. There are uniquely colored amenity boxes and toilet paper holders here and there, so the feeling of a vaccine continues into the bathroom. You might be wondering where the mini-quick is. It\u0027s in the closet on the wall you saw earlier. There\u0027s an espresso capsule machine and a Philips coffee pot. Most notably, the porcelain box and traditional bojagi teacups are eye-catching. Honey, Mane\u0027s porcelain teacup is so delicious that you\u0027ll fall asleep if you eat it. There\u0027s a variety of Osulloc spirits. In addition to the tartan, there\u0027s also a separate set. The refrigerator is also in the closet on the wall. It\u0027s inside, and all minibar drinks except alcohol are free, and snacks and chocolates are also free. Is this a service inspired by the warmth of Korea and the second-rate of Korean culture? Even the slippers are provided in a set of blue and yellow, which are the main colors. The rooms you\u0027ve seen so far are the deluxe, which is a mid-level among the basic rooms of Anda G. I asked the hotel for cooperation and took pictures of other rooms because I thought you might be curious about other rooms. Among the standard rooms, there is a premium room that is 9 square meters wider than the deluxe room I stayed in. It\u0027s almost like a deluxe room, but you can think of it as having a little more space. The difference is that the inside of the bathroom is decorated with a single height. The cheapest room is the standard room with a floor space of 33 square meters. It\u0027s definitely not that far from the foot of the bed to the table. The bathroom also feels noticeably different from other rooms. Personally, the difference in room size between the standard and deluxe rooms is large compared to the price difference, so I recommend the deluxe over the standard at that time. Let\u0027s go to the suite that the hotel is proud of. It\u0027s the largest and widest penjaup in the hotel. It\u0027s a spacious room with two tables and a can sofa at 163 square meters.  It looks great for holding a first birthday party or other commemorative events. Above all, it is connected to the outdoor garden, so it would be nice to have a group gathering without worrying about others these days. There is a separate space that is good for watching movies with your family. There is also a bedroom with a king bed inside. As expected from a penthouse, it has a spacious bathroom and a bathtub, and there is also a shower in the guest bathroom, so it is definitely a good room for small gatherings or events. If the penthouse is the best, there is the Andajee Suite among the general suites. As expected from a 7T, the living room and bedroom are separated, but the wall decoration behind the sofa is similar to that of other rooms. The bedroom and bathtub are inside, separated by a wall. If you feel uncomfortable because the basic rooms are not separated, this would be a good choice. The Balcony Suite is almost the same as the Andajee Suite, but as the name suggests, it has a balcony. It could be a good option for those who want a developer. Shall we go to the swimming pool that one group is proud of? The Summer House, located on the second basement level, is a space with a Hyungjang Gwapi tennis spa. In the basement  Instead of having a view, a screen was installed on one wall to give the feeling of being outdoors. The pool was quite large and decorated with a sense of style, which was nice. In particular, on one side, the space where the beads are located was separated by wooden beams to create a unique atmosphere. On the other side, a Jacuzzi was installed with a raised platform to warm the body. Next to the swimming pool, IFP Tunis equipment was installed. Although it is not a very large space, the facilities are clean and the equipment is well-organized. The fact that there is a space for Pilates inside is a great advantage of Nanda GPT Nice. Overall, the pool and fitness center had a modern hotel-like feel. Although the feel and scale were not overwhelming, it had a modern, sophisticated facility that suited me well. Let\u0027s take a look at the hotel-style food and beverage establishment run by the flowers, Jogakbo, is on the second floor. Jogakbo, which was created with the concept of 10 alleys in South America, can be found in three spaces if you look closely. Among them, seafood dishes are served, and breakfast is served on weekdays as an a la carte menu, and on weekends, it is served as a breakfast.  Breakfast is served buffet style for 2 people. In the case of the a la carte menu, if you order the representative menu above, you can order unlimited items included in it. In the case of the menu I ordered, it was an egg dish and an assortment of pastries, yogurt, and fruit juice. In the case of Korean food, the special menu changes daily, and on the day I stayed, a Korean set meal including seaweed soup and bulgogi was served. In addition, I tried the 90-percent pancake and it was also good. However, unlike the Park Hyatt Seoul where you can eat as much as you want regardless of the menu if you use the all-you-can-eat menu, it was disappointing that at Bandagi, you can only order from the category you selected. In addition to breakfast, there are two more food and beverage establishments in Jogakbo 4. Fortunately, the meeting room in the innermost part is the most formal of the three complexes, with black tables and burgundy chairs. The room prepared inside is quite spacious, so it doesn\u0027t look stuffy even in private.  It seems like a good place to do it. It \u0027s a foot-friendly lobby lounge and parlor located around the stairs connected to the lobby. In fact, there is no club lounge that doesn\u0027t have a bar. Instead, there is a bubble menu similar to the club lounge\u0027s happy hour at Ihn Wine. The name is a bit confusing, but it\u0027s meaningful. The 44,000 won price is unlimited use of three types of wine. It includes a ham and cheese plate that goes well with wine, a portion of truffle French fries, a flower with a thick pick, and even a dessert of delicious tala mal jjok (ice cream) that is so delicious. In fact, the quality of food at the club lounge often falls depending on the hotel, but this course-style food is delicious and the portions are larger than expected, so I was full. It\u0027s a bit disappointing that the usage time is only 2 hours, but these days, most club lounges have a time limit. Personally, I recommend the Double M Balchi if you don\u0027t have a bar. Afternoon tea is served during the day at Ihn Wine. It features illustrations by artist Jeon Ye-ji.  The afternoon tea served in the secret box is truly Instagram-worthy. The box contains dry ice, which steams as it\u0027s served. Opening the box will make even those who don\u0027t use Instagram feel like they need to update their Instagram account. The cotton candy coffee served before the afternoon tea is also very unique and fun. There \u0027s also a bakery inside the reception area on the second floor, and there\u0027s also a kidnapping service. So, what\u0027s your overall review of Andaji Seoul? It\u0027s a young and fresh hotel, but it \u0027s definitely a place where opinions will differ. While Andaji doesn\u0027t have the grand, optional port that we typically think of, it has a unique, youthful, and sensuous feel to it, making it an attractive hotel for 20 people. Especially, for those who have experienced the bitter cold, which can be similar or predictable, I think the uniquely designed rooms will be refreshing. Regardless of the outcome, I think the fact that they studied various cultural elements to bring out the Korean feel in a 5-star hotel of a global chain and incorporated those inspirations into the hotel deserves applause. However, as I mentioned earlier, for those who value the view,  I can\u0027t recommend it at all. It might not suit those who prefer the heaviness and luxury of a 5-star hotel. However, the concept and atmosphere of the clothes are quite refreshing for the young people who are called the blind generation these days. Although it is not operated by the hotel, it would be good for Doman or Elite to have trendy and hot food and beverage establishments such as Blue Boat Lina and Tap WC in the same building. In particular, the transportation is so good that it is a great place for friends to gather for a birthday party or a year-end gathering. It is a bit awkward to break it down by generation, but I think that tastes will clearly differ compared to other hotels, and I think it is a choice that is more suitable for young people.

{"video_id":"jOp4YGO_DOs","lang":"en-US","full_text":"This hotel is supposedly the best in all of  South Korea, so I did a full review to see if that\u0027s true.This is the SHILLA Seoul! The SHILLA has been here in Seoul for forty years and is the go-to for K-Pop stars,  old money, and royalty here in South Korea. It is owned by the technology company  Samsung, and it has a luxury pastry shop, a high-end mall, and so much more that  I\u0027ll show you later in this review. I do reviews out of 50 points in five categories.  The categories are; The Ambiance, The Room, The Dining, The Service, and the It-Factor. I\u0027m not sponsored by the hotel, it\u0027s just an honest, genuine review from  someone paying full price to stay here. With that, let\u0027s go take a look around the hotel,  because I think you\u0027re gonna like this one... In my opinion, the best thing to do here at the SHILLA is the nature walk that they  have all throughout the property. It goes right next to the Seoul  fortress wall and is so serene. They\u0027re playing little music as  well, while you walk around. The SHILLA has an outdoor pool called the  Urban Island, which is one of the most visually striking and interesting parts of the hotel,  but unfortunately it is closed six months out of the year. They do, however, have an indoor pool  with a jacuzzi, cold, hot, and warm plunge pools, and a full nude spa, so you can make use of  all of those while the outdoor pool is closed. In the men\u0027s locker room they give you a full  outfit to change into, that you can actually take with you and use while you are here in  the pool, in the sauna, the spa, or in the gym. In the indoor pool, there are three lap lanes here  that are 25 meters in length, and a full jacuzzi as well. Overall, the sauna and pool areas are not  as sanitary or clean as I would have liked to see. The floors are wet everywhere and that really  takes away from the experience. So the SHILLA\u0027s age demographic is definitely older, so they have  heath and wellness programs in place to help with that longevity. The exercise prescription room  then gives you a workout routine that you go into the gym and ostensibly do every day. The gym  itself is not that modern or updated, but it is spacious. There\u0027s a lot of equipment in there,  but we\u0027ve definitely seen more updated gyms. It is super popular during the day,  very full so, worth the investment on their end to get some new equipment in there. Funnily enough, when I asked about the spa, they let me know that it is closed indefinitely  Spas are very popular and famous in South Korea, and the Four Seasons and Signiel both  have functioning spas with robust menus, so hopefully the SHILLA gets theirs up and  running soon, and gets back in the race. Last but not least, there is a shopping  mall in the lobby of this hotel. It\u0027s got some of my favorite brands like Molton Brown,  which is also the soap in the room that we\u0027ll see a little bit later. There\u0027s Hermés, Louis  Vuitton, and so many other luxury brands here. Normally I am not a big fan of malls inside  of hotels, it feels a little tacky, but here at the SHILLA, I actually think the luxury  integration plays nicely, and has good place here. The architecture and interiors here are definitely  interesting, you\u0027ve got this kind of bland boring high-rise, next to an ancient temple. It  feels like you are in the Cosmopolitan, like this chandelier, mixed with a  street from the 1400\u0027s Josun Dynasty. The hotel itself, public spaces wise, is a  little bit worn down, and 40 years of age is definitely starting to show. It could use  a refurbishment in some of the spaces here, but overall with the view of the Namsan tower, the  mountains that you can see from most of the rooms, and the fact that they have invested a lot into  their public spaces, I gave the Ambiance a 7/10. We checked in, got our room card, now let\u0027s  go see the room. Here at the SHILLA there are 464 rooms, over 23 floors, including the suites. So this is the standard business room here at the SHILLA. Basically, the base rate. I\u0027m also gonna  show you some footage that we got in the SHILLA suite, which by the way is $9,000 more per night,  but most who are watching this would probably book this room right here or something similar. On first glance right when you walk in, it does look like a well-designed room, but  you can tell immediately that the materials are not as high quality as some of the other five  star hotels. A good example this is the walls, all have this kind of off-white fabric on it that  feels a little bit low quality, everything in the room is pretty beat up, from the lamp shades, to  the desk, it is at a high level of wear-and-tear, probably to the point where it\u0027s time to replace  or do a renovation. And generally speaking, I don\u0027t love the room. It does feel like it\u0027s kind  of just a boring plain room with a lot of tans and whites, but not used in a very interesting  or elegant way. There\u0027s no pops of color, the artwork is very neutral, over here  near the entrance, you\u0027ve got the mini bar, which has some pretty standard snacks, which  is interesting because we\u0027re in South Korea, normally there\u0027s some South Korea snacks,  but you\u0027ve got Pringles, and pretzels. This is kind of cool, so this comes off here,  and you have your liquor here, but there is no Nespresso machine or coffee machine that I  could see in the room. So you have your tea here, and I think this is instant coffee if you put  it in a cup - but there\u0027s no coffee machine, which at this price point, is really strange. Moving over to the bed, this looks like a very thin sheet on top, the pillows don\u0027t look overly  comfortable. The headboard is the same way. It\u0027s this \u0027pleather\u0027, fake leather, you can see that  because a lot of it has been scratched off. But the real way to test is to do an official  bed test, so I\u0027m going to sleep in this bed, wake up and let you know how it is. But at first  glance, it does look like the rest of the room, which is... kind of cheap and low quality. The bathroom is connected to the room and separated only by this sliding  door which is glass. Very simple. There is a tub, a very deep tub here.  Generally speaking it is above average, I would say, for a standard bathroom. There is a large shower with a great looking overhead rain component to it,  so let\u0027s definitely give that a test. The Shower Test is based on three  factors like always, which are the Size, the Pressure, and the Ease of Use. So right away, you can see the size is excellent. Pretty easy to use. You turn this on, on the  left side. The pressure is pretty consistent, although it\u0027s a little bit weak. It\u0027s definitely  a simple shower, turn it left or right, and the heat controls are down below it. So  generally speaking, passed the shower test. So one more important thing before  we leave this bathroom; all of the amenities in here are Molton Brown, which is my  #1 favorite hotel brand for lotion, hair care, skin care, everything is very high quality. So as I mentioned, this is the base room, but I also want you to take a look really quickly  at the SHILLA suite, again a $9,000 USD upgrade from this room, the base room, but it\u0027s a  lot more spacious. You\u0027ll notice a lot of the materials in this room that you\u0027re looking at  are the same quality level as what you\u0027re seeing in the base level. It is also pretty worn down,  the shower is bigger, yes, but at the same time it is not the level of luxury that you would  expect with a room rate over $10,000 a night. Back into the main room, you have a dining table,  there\u0027s a conference table here in the main room, so a lot of space, probably made for those that  are taking business meetings or a dinner that they are throwing in Seoul, and less for someone  looking for a luxurious, comfortable stay. Now nighttime in the room, getting ready  to head to sleep, this light is flickering, don\u0027t know what\u0027s going on with that.  I am going to do a full bed test now, sleep in this bed throughout the night, and  I\u0027ll wake up and let you know what I thought. OK. The bed is better than I thought. It is not a  Four Seasons bed, that\u0027s for sure. It\u0027s definitely a comfortable sleep, especially this California  King size. The pillows are softer than I thought. So overall, I thought it was a pretty  good bed. Let\u0027s give it that Room Score. So that is the Room. Let\u0027s start with a couple of  the positives; the bed and the shower were really excellent - they were surprisingly excellent  actually, slept in the bed last night, it was a great night\u0027s sleep, and took a shower this  morning and it was equally great. Unfortunately there were more negatives than positives in this  room, for example the lack of modern integration and technology in this room, the missing coffee  machine which is really kind of unheard of at this level, and the fact that the room is pretty worn  down and in need of a refurbishment. One thing I didn\u0027t mention before is that the room is lacking  any kind of incorporation of the Korean culture, or people, or artists of the area... it  just lacks any kind of personalization or special touch. I gave the Room a 6.5/10. So now there are 8 restaurants and bars here at the SHILLA. Why not start with the famous  and legendary brunch here at The Parkview. There is a restaurant and a bar, both in  this area. The restaurant has small bites, but you can also order a Royal Tea Set, which  I did, for this review. So this Royal Tea Set comes with two cups of their premium  tea, as well as a multi-tiered dessert and pastry tray that they are going to bring out in a second. Look at this tower. So, tea towers like this, or Royal Tea Sets are pretty popular here in South Korea. This  one has a lot of different options here, we have scones, we\u0027ve got sandwiches, there are light  bites that are a little bit more premium, and then at the end is the strawberry themed dessert.  I\u0027m going to try all of them and incorporate that into the Dining Score. WOW. That is very dry. OK,  not the best start, let\u0027s keep going. That one\u0027s better, still dry. Wow, might not be able to talk  after this, it\u0027s like chalk. Alright here we go. Look I know scones are supposed to be dry, but  that is some next level dry-ness that is happening here. Miniature croissant. That is nice. Sandwich  from when I was a kid and they cut the crust off. Surprisingly very good. Chocolate covered  strawberry, which, I\u0027m a big fan of. Wow. The presentation is really the key here, but would you come specifically to the SHILLA  for this tea set? Probably not. This is Palsun, it\u0027s a high-end Chinese restaurant. Now none  of the restaurants here have a Michelin star, but there are a lot of places to eat; you  have a ton of choices at the SHILLA. So ordered the most popular thing on the menu  here, the dumplings, they are very hot, and they give you a little sauce to dip  them in. Unbelievably good dumplings here, perfectly cooked, great flavor. Oh my gosh. Mmmm! This is the spicy cashew chicken, which they told me is very spicy. Wow. That might be the best cashew chicken I\u0027ve ever  had. Really, really amazing. And not too spicy. This is my favorite restaurant  at the SHILLA so far. Now to the Pastry Boutique which was designed to  look like a high end jewelry boutique. They sell ultra-premium items and some  exclusive pastries here as well. Alright so the Pastry Boutique in the  lobby actually doesn\u0027t have any seating, and we tried to sit down and they kicked us out  and said that the Pastry Boutique is only to go, and you have to eat it in your room or take it  somewhere else to eat it, which is so strange. So, here we are back in the room for the Pastry  Boutique. We have a couple of their most popular items here, including a Popsicle. One thing they  do very well in South Korea is their pastries and desserts. They always look like pieces  of art in South Korea. Alright here we go. It almost has a brownie interior, there\u0027s some  cream in there, green tea white chocolate on the outside. That is great. Moving on  to this - not quite sure what this is, they just mentioned it is one of the most popular  items that they have. It looks like a ice cream sandwich, but it is not cold. Mmm! Wow. So the  pastries, of course, are great. There\u0027s not a huge selection of pastries there, and the  fact that they made us eat it in the room isn\u0027t great for the Service Score, but we are  judging only based on the quality of the actual food itself. So let\u0027s get back downstairs,  and try out another one of the restaurants. Now we\u0027re here in Ariake which is a  Japanese restaurant at the SHILLA, they have sushi, sashimi, and udon pot  noodles, which is what I ordered tonight. The broth is delicious. The udon noodles are  a little overcooked, maybe that\u0027s the style? They are kind of gummy, like chewy. And the second  most popular dish here; the buckwheat hot noodle. The noodles in this one are really really well  cooked, and have a lot more flavor. Overall, it is a very solid Japanese restaurant, course  we didn\u0027t try the sushi tonight and sashimi, which I am sure are excellent, I would say  a pretty good addition to that Dining Score. This is the Distiller\u0027s Lounge, which is  right next to the lounge that you saw before. This is one of their tasting rooms, it  actually just opened in March of this year, and it truly is a genuinely beautiful space.  Probably the most beautiful space utilization in all of the SHILLA hotel. They have these  incredible distillery samples here that are the wall on one side. It\u0027s very peaceful and calm,  there\u0027s some hidden doors that look like they are behind different bookshelves and things like  that to take you to your private tasting rooms. They do exclusive whisky tastings here that  you cannot get anywhere else in South Korea. There are two other restaurants not shown here.  La Yeon, a Korean restaurant, and Continental, a French restaurant. Even though we booked in  advance and went in person to confirm the booking, they told us it is completely booked out for  the week, which is a great transition to the Service here. But before that, let\u0027s talk about  the Dining Score. So the dining overall here, the restaurants are beautiful, the dishes  were well placed, the flavors were above average, I gave The Dining a 7/10. Generally speaking, I film these reviews respectfully, I pay full price, I shoot first  thing in the morning, and I never show other guests in the video. Because of that, the hotel  lets us make these reviews the way that I want to. Unfortunately my team and I this entire  stay have felt pretty unwelcome by the SHILLA, which is really disappointing. We were told that  we can\u0027t eat our desserts in the public areas, that restaurants were full when there was no one  in them, that lounge spaces aren\u0027t available to us, even though they are supposed to be included  in our stay. I really never have seen anything like that at a five star resort, whether  I\u0027ve reviewed it or not on this channel. We thought maybe it was the fact that we were  filming, but honestly no one has spoken to us about filming specifically, it just seems like  there\u0027s a disconnect in the Service and the way in which they\u0027ve communicated that to us. Now that\u0027s not to say every staff here was disrespectful or rude, actually a few of them  did go out of their way to make it a great stay for us. But unfortunately, that was the minority.  Because of that, the Service Score is not looking very good for this hotel, but we do have to do  an official Service Test and see how they do. So now it\u0027s time for that Service Test.  The Service Test is the part of this review where I call the front desk and I ask for  something a little bit strange or different than what they are used to, to see how they  accommodate. Here at the SHILLA they have two things that they really promote. #1 is Teddy  Bears, and #2 is their Pastry Shop that also makes cakes. So I\u0027m going to call the front  desk and see if they can combine those two. Hi there, I have a quick request for  you for something brought to the room, would it be possible to have a cake of a Teddy  Bear, like in the lobby, brought to the room? Yes. And if there were some  balloons, that would be even better. Can I do that over the phone here? Yes, that\u0027s no problem, I\u0027ll be here. Thank you very much. You too, bye bye. Alright, so, it sounds like they might be able to accommodate the cake request, which I  know is a last minute pretty out there request. What they said I have to do is pay for it  down stairs, move it to the bell desk myself, the bell desk will then bring it up to the room,  set it up in the room for later today. Which is, a little bit clunky I think as a guest if you\u0027re  paying for the cake, but let\u0027s see if they\u0027re able to do it, and what ends up happening. Hello, at the front desk they mentioned you might be able to do the bear cake for Walker.  Is that something you are able to do? Okay great! Yes! Yeah, do you have that today by chance? It\u0027s sold out? The days are done? No more? That\u0027s too bad. Alright so they can\u0027t do the bear cake, but they  can sell me a bear, so, technically failed the Service Test, but I will go home with this guy. The SHILLA is an iconic hotel, think The Beverly Hilton is Los Angeles or the Plaza in New York.  And sometimes what can happen with iconic hotels, is they get a little bit of an ego. And that  ego can translate to the guest experience. After reading reviews online, and after having my  own experience here, I can confirm that this is unfortunately true. Because I didn\u0027t feel  welcomed or appreciated during this stay, which are the most important parts of the  Service Score, I gave The Service a 4.5/10. So this hotel is a member of the Leading Hotels  of the World, a prestigious organization, and Condé Nast named it the best hotel in South  Korea. But what really makes this hotel special is the integration of the Korean architecture into  the space. Also when you stay here, you feel like you\u0027re rubbing elbows with distinguished people  and VIPs that they welcome from this country. That\u0027s really the It-Factor. The It-Factor is that  special thing about a hotel that makes you want to come back again and again. That feels like you  need to tell your friends and family about it, and you should take a special trip to stay there.  If it wasn\u0027t for all of the Korean architecture, this would just be another luxury high-rise  hotel. However, many other hotels in the city have hosted distinguished people  or integrate the Korean culture, so I don\u0027t know how unique the SHILLA is in that  point. Also the main building where you actually stay is kind of a non-de-script brown high-rise  building, which doesn\u0027t make it feel as special as maybe the Signiel at the top of LOTTE Tower.  For these reasons I gave the It-Factor a 6.5/10. So that is the SHILLA hotel here in  Seoul, South Korea. Unfortunately, it is now time to officially check out,  and give it that final score out of 50. The SHILLA Seoul overall unfortunately  is not a hotel that I would recommend, it\u0027s a little bit tired, it\u0027s a bit worn out,  and it\u0027s a little bit too pretentious for the average person who may want to stay here. I gave  the SHILLA here in Seoul South Korea a 31.5/50. Thank you so much for watching, I am Ryan  Walker, and we\u0027ll see you on the next one."}
{"video_id":"OjsZTM9C1Dg","lang":"en","full_text":"ღ [Music] Hi guys, welcome back to our channel Ktashing Adventures.  And for today\u0027s video, we\u0027ll give you our quick room tour here at Novotel Suit at Ambassador Yong San.  Let\u0027s go.  So, this is our room and we are staying in a junior suite room here at Novatel Yong Sun.  So, let\u0027s go to the area that upon entering the room, this is what you will see which is our luggage rack and also the cabinet. Then we have a laundry area here. They provide a washing machine and dryer in one.  He\u0027s two in one.  So when you need to do laundry, you can do it here.  And also they also have laundry detergent provided here. Then they also have a shoe shine sponge.  And of course the shoe horn will not disappear.  There you go. Over here is the cabinet.  So you can see here you can hang clothes.  Then they also have an iron and ironing board.  They also provide sleepers here.  And here inside, guys, we have a mini kitchen here.  So, it has a sink where you can wash the things you used and they also provided a sponge and dishwashing liquid that we can use when washing the things we used for eating.  And over here is the kitchen cabinet.  You can see the kettle here, an electric kettle.  Then there\u0027s the ice tray on the other side.  Empty space you can put your stocks.  Here.  In this part, they have a cabinet.  Then here you can see the glasses.  There are wine glasses, there are glasses for water. Then they have this wine opener.  And also the microwave. Most of the hotels we stayed in did n\u0027t have microwaves.  So it\u0027s a big deal that we have this because when we\u0027re too lazy to eat at a restaurant, we can get takeout or we can just buy it at a convenience store. We can heat it here.  And then this is their mini fridge.  How do you open that?   It\u0027s just empty.  Just water. Just two waters.  And their counter top here is also very spacious.  So you can dine in here. You can also work because they have provided a chair here.  Then this is the coffee and tea making. So they have a nespresso machine. Here they also have capsules provided, of course.

Here, guys, on the bedside table, of course, there\u0027s a telephone that you can use to contact the reception or housekeeping.  Then take note, this is the socket here in Korea.  That\u0027s why it\u0027s very important that you have an international adapter. But here at the nootel they also put in an additional outlet like this.  But most of our stays at hotels here in Korea are like this because this is the original.  On the other bedside table, they have provided a speaker. So you can play music or go on a sound trip.  That\u0027s a Bluetooth speaker. It also has a manual on how to use it and it has a USB port.  You can charge there. And the other one is the plug here.  So earlier we saw the telephone with a large screen on the bedside table.  It\u0027s a touch screen.  That\u0027s how we can control our inroom lighting.  Then over here is the control for our air conditioner.  And the bathroom lights.  Let\u0027s go into the bathroom now.  This is our bathroom.  So this is what you will see .  This is the sink.

{"video_id":"PeZWgQgDw48","lang":"en","full_text":"Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of One Trip at a Time. We are back in Seoul and today we are taking you to a hotel right in the heart of the city. Located between Maongdong and Ulj, it is in the middle of Soul\u0027s busiest shopping and business districts. This hotel is none other than L City Hotel, Maongdong. This property is part of the L hotels and resorts, Korea\u0027s largest chain of hotels. Specifically, it belongs to the chain\u0027s upscale portfolio, L City Hotel, a brand comprised of four-star properties targeted to business and leisure travelers. In this video, we will take a tour of the property and review whether it\u0027s the ideal hotel for your trip to Seoul. Let\u0027s head inside and start exploring from the ground floor. On the left side after the entrance, there are practical facilities like an ATM for quick withdrawals and an Angel and US coffee shop, which is also a brand owned by the Latte Group. It is conveniently accessible for a morning latte or a relaxing coffee or tea break after a busy day in the city. Now, let\u0027s make our way up to the second floor, home to the hotel\u0027s main lobby and front office and the central point of arrival for all guests. As you step out of the elevator, the hotel\u0027s front desk is located to the left. The elegantly designed lobby makes a strong first impression. Its aesthetics is best described as modern yet understated, embodying quiet luxury through refined materials and thoughtful layout. The space has abundant natural light which highlights the clean minimalist design and ample seating areas where guests can comfortably wait during check-in. The seamless integration of technology including selfch checkck-in kiosks and wallpass machine strikes a harmonious balance between efficiency and comfort. As for the check-in, the process was smooth and efficient with friendly front desk who made the experience welcoming. We were able to get our room quickly without any hassle, setting a positive tone for the stay. On the opposite side of the second floor, to the right of the elevator, you will find additional facilities. These include fully equipped conference rooms. Across these is a business corner arranged with desktop computers and a printer, providing guests with space to catch up on work, prepare business documents, or browse the web in a professional environment. You will then come across an autopay kiosk where you can conveniently pay for your parking before you leave. Just a few steps further is Saffron Restaurant. We didn\u0027t try this restaurant, but apparently it\u0027s known for its authentic and premium Middle Eastern halal menu. From the outside, the interior exudes a warm and refined ambiance enhanced by ornate Middle Eastern design. Also located on the second floor is a door that leads to a balcony. This open air terrace offers a refreshing escape with panoramic views of the busting city streets below. Surrounded by towering office buildings, it provides a unique vantage point to observe the vibrant urban life and a connection to the energy of the district without ever leaving the property. Let\u0027s make our way back down to the ground level using the escalator and explore a few more convenient features in the hotel. At the bottom of the escalator is a secondary entrance, a quieter back entryway that leads into a small counter which is set up for quick assistance or inquiries away from the bottle of the main lobby. There\u0027s also a set of brochure shelves neatly stocked with local travel guides, maps, and event flyers. Just a few steps away is a 7-Eleven convenience store open around the clock for anything you might need on the go. It\u0027s a practical touch to the hotel\u0027s features. Here\u0027s a look at the hotel directory where everything is clearly laid out by floor. Let\u0027s head to the third floor next to check out some wellness and utility facilities. Here we are on the third floor. In addition to the guest rooms located here, this level is also home to three key facilities that enhance guest experience. The first facility you will find here is the fitness center. Whether you\u0027re squeezing in a quick workout or sticking to your regular routine, this gym is well equipped. Complimentary bottled water, fresh towels, and gym mats are readily available to help you stay comfortable during your session. As for equipment, there\u0027s a solid variety to suit different fitness goals and workout styles. There is an adjustable bench that can be used for presses, rows, and other free weight exercises. Of course, there\u0027s a full rack of dumbbells next to it. In addition to free weights, the gym is equipped with multi-station machines that combine several resistance exercises into one compact unit, ideal if you\u0027re looking for a comprehensive workout. If you are focused on cardio exercises, there\u0027s a selection of modern machines, including treadmills, ellipticals, and stationary bikes, all of which looks to be well-maintained and positioned for easy access. Ab exercise benches are also available, great for your crunches, situps, leg raises, and core workouts. The gym also features a body belt vibrator, a throwback to old fitness trends, yet still appreciated by some for warm-ups or recovery sessions. The space is designed to be practical with floor to-seeiling mirrors that help create a sense of openness while also allowing you to monitor your form and posture during workouts. The fitness center is actually pretty solid, clean, well stocked, and has everything you need for a workout while traveling. After your workout, if you need to freshen up your gym clothes, you will find the coin laundry room conveniently located a few steps away. Honestly, this type of facility comes in really handy, especially if you\u0027re staying for more than a couple of nights. It has four sets of washers and tumble dryers, so even if a couple of machines are in use, there\u0027s still a good chance you\u0027ll find one free. They\u0027ve put up clear step-by-step instructions on the wall, so even if you\u0027ve never used a coin laundry setup before, you won\u0027t be confused. There\u0027s a detergent vending machine in case you didn\u0027t pack any, plus a bill and coin changer, which is handy if you\u0027re out of small change. There are even laundry baskets which saves you from juggling armfuls of clothes between machines. Once you have your laundry going, you don\u0027t have to just stand around waiting for the cycle to finish. Positioned just beside the laundry area is this multi-room. This nice little space features seating areas. Nothing too fancy, but comfortable enough to sit and relax while you wait. There\u0027s a microwave, probably meant for guests who bring along something to eat. A flat screen TV is mounted on the wall to catch some shows and help pass the time. You will also find several irons and steamers available if you want to press your freshly washed clothes or just give an outfit a quick refresh before heading out for a business meeting or a dinner date. Even with these selfservice options though, the hotel still offers traditional laundry service if you prefer to have it handled for you. Now, let\u0027s head up to our room. We are staying on the 21st floor. There are 435 rooms here with a variety to choose from standard rooms, superior rooms, deluxe family rooms, premier family rooms, and superior suites. All right, we are finally here. Room 2118. Tada. Let\u0027s have a room tour. Welcome to L City Hotel, Maongdong\u0027s superior double room. This is a 25 square meter room. As you step in, you will find a dedicated luggage rack to keep your bags off the floor. Mounted on the wall is a 43in flat screen TV that comes with an OTT box so you can enjoy Netflix streaming services. Just below it is a long console style desk that\u0027s both stylish and functional. Discreetly tucked inside is the mini refrigerator. There are also multiple drawers that hold all essential amenities, including the hotel compendium, the coffee and tea station, and an electric kettle. And of course, the surface of the console doubles as a working desk, giving you plenty of space to sit down with your laptop and other work necessities. It is topped with a sleek leather executive desk pad paired with a comfortable work chair accented by a modern study lamp and equipped with convenient multiport outlets. It is a good setup especially if you are working remotely. Across the working desk is a sitting corner. It features a stylish accent chair paired with a coffee table positioned right by the window. Next to it is the heart of the room, the double bed. This bed is from the Heon private brand, exclusively designed by Simmons in collaboration with Latte Hotels. It comes topped with four fluffy pillows, crisp white linens, and a cozy duvet. The sleep during our stay was comfortable and restful. It allowed us to wake up feeling refreshed, recharged, and ready for every new day of touring soul. A few steps from the bed, you\u0027ll find the closet laid out in the usual hotel fashion right next to the entrance door. Inside, there\u0027s a full set of hangers and two bathrooms. On the lower shelf, there\u0027s a digital safe for your valuables, hotel slippers, laundry bags, and even a fire extinguisher for safety. Now, let\u0027s head into the bathroom and see what we\u0027ve got. First up, here\u0027s the shower area. It looks clean and spacious. Its beige colored tiles give it a warm, calming feel, almost like a spa. There\u0027s a large rain shower head overhead with hot and cold water option. The bath amenities are by Davines, a premium Italian brand known for its sustainable and high quality products. In compliance to a new environmental law, hotels in Korea no longer provide disposable toothbrushes or singleuse toiletries, so be sure to pack your own. Moving to the other side is the smart toilet. It features warm water, twin nozzles for both front and rear cleansing, and of course, heated seat. All in all, the bathroom is clean, functional, and quietly echocious. By the way, we booked this room for 300,8001 per night, taxes included. This rate covered the room accommodation, Wi-Fi, and access to all the hotels facilities. Just so you know, the room rate we booked didn\u0027t include breakfast. We wanted the flexibility to eat only when we had time instead of being tied to it every morning. But of course, we had to try it. So, let us show you what the breakfast spread looks like. This is Tea Cafe at the 27th floor. The restaurant\u0027s design is a blend of modern minimalism and natural warmth. Its floor to-seeiling windows offer panoramic views of Maongdong, while its neutral tones give a business-like and upscale vibe. Let\u0027s check out the spread. Over here is the hearty hot dish corner with beef bulgogi, baked fish, sausages, bacon, and fried rice. The live egg station is actually combined with a dim sum and noodle area, which can be a bit confusing. And to add to that, you\u0027ll also find items like fries, sauteed vegetables, and boiled eggs placed right in front. So, just be sure to take a look around before lining up since multiple dishes are being served from the same counter. This one here is the soup station topped neatly in its own corner. It offers three different types of soups every morning. Then there\u0027s a Korean side dish station, a full salad bar, and even a pasta station for those who want something more filling. There\u0027s also a cold cut section of salmon, assorted sliced meats, and cheeses, which fits right into the build your own light breakfast corner of the buffet. There\u0027s also a fruit selection with fresh sliced options along with a variety of yogurt choices. Right next is a cereal station offering a mix of classic favorites and healthier options. And here\u0027s the bread and pastry station with a nice variety of toasts, croissants, pies, and sweet pastries. To top it all off, there\u0027s a coffee and tea station and a beverage bar with a range of fresh fruit juices. Now that we\u0027ve had a look at the spread, here are our thoughts. For the price of 30,0001 per person, the breakfast buffet at the hotel offers a decent variety with a well-rounded selection of options. However, the food quality is fairly average, which is what you will expect from a typical business style hotel buffet. And that pretty much wraps up our stay here at L City Hotel Mongdong. From the room to the breakfast and everything in between, we have given you a look at what you can expect. Now, before we go, here are our thoughts based on our stay experience. We are giving L City Hotel Maongdong Dong a score of 8.57. The property\u0027s location is perfect and it\u0027s spotless clean. While the hotel\u0027s facilities are modern and well-maintained, it lacks some leisure amenities commonly found in four-star properties worldwide, such as a swimming pool, a dedicated spa, or even a lobby lounge, which makes the price feel a bit on the higher side. The hotel could also benefit from improving the quality of its food in its allday dining outlet. All in all, the hotel offers a pleasant and satisfactory stay. A solid choice for your trip to Seoul.

{"video_id":"OyJ7gQ7gEvk","lang":"en","full_text":"Before the MGallery opened, this was the only hotel with a view of the Han River in Korea. It\u0027s just one hotel, but it\u0027s actually a place where hotels from all over the world are gathered. Let\u0027s find out what it\u0027s like there, operated by the conglomerate SK, with a man. [Music] Hello, I\u0027m Ttotto Man. In 1963, there were no proper resorts in Korea, so many US soldiers stationed in Korea went on vacation to Japan. To prevent this, the government took the lead in building the Walkerhill Hotel, the first all-resort hotel in Korea, at the foot of Achasan Mountain in Seoul Gwangjang-dong. Since it was initially built as a facility for US soldiers stationed in Korea, the hotel was named after Walter H. Walker, a hero of the Korean War and the first and 8th Army Commander. Then, in July 1978, the Sheraton Walkerhill Hotel, which is 18 stories above ground and 4 stories underground, which became the predecessor of today\u0027s Grand Walkerhill, opened. In 2004, the W Seoul Walkerhill, which became the predecessor of today\u0027s Vista Walkerhill, opened. The Sheraton and W Hotel signs, which are overseas brands, are  It was separated in 2017 and has since been operated under its own brands, Grand Walkerhill and Vista Walkerhill. In addition, the Douglas Hotel, built during the construction period, was also renovated and reopened in 2018, so there are now three hotels within the Walkerhill Hotel. The 1973 is bright and has a sense of weight. On the other hand, the similar Walkerhill has a wooden sculpture at the entrance and even media art above it, giving it the feel of a hip club. The hotel\u0027s predecessor was the W Hotel, the hippest of the Marriott brands, and that influence still remains. The Robin Hood\u0027s sign isn\u0027t high or grand, but it enlivens the atmosphere with colorful furniture and cushions that match the hip atmosphere. The check-in desk, on the other hand, looks rather ordinary. However, the biggest difference between the two hotels is the guest rooms. Let\u0027s take a look at the Walkerhill rooms with a similar hip feel first. First, I stayed in the Junior Corner Suite, the most popular hotel in the hotel. The use of White Tony from the floor to the furniture in the room is unique. It\u0027s interesting that the circular lights on the ceiling match the circular bed. The bed and carpet are in the same neutral color scheme, creating a perfect atmosphere. The colors are also great.  The unique, yet most appealing aspect of the Junior Suite is the view of the Han River from two directions. To the east, you can see the yet-to-be-opened Godeok Bridge, and to the west, the Olympic Bridge and Lotte Tower. You can also see the Gangbyeonbuk-ro Road, which is open and clear, below. This is one of the few five-star hotels in Korea with a clear view of the Han River. However, one thing that\u0027s disappointing is that there are small dots painted on the windows, so the view is not clear but rather hazy. I think this is to prevent people from seeing outside, but it\u0027s reallydisappointing. Furthermore, the blinds cannot be fully opened, and the upper part is always covered, reducing the view from 100 points to 80. At the head of the circular bed is a work table shaped like the bed. On top of it is an AI speaker, a CD player (hard to find these days), a box of office supplies, a coffee pot, and a UV sterilizer. The room is neatly decorated in white tones, but with so many things on it, it feels a bit cluttered. However, the drinks and snacks in the refrigerator are free, which is nice. Opposite the bed is a table and chair with a TV. However, it\u0027s not a smart TV, which is a must-have for staycations these days, so it\u0027s very difficult to watch Netflix or YouTube. The white and curved theme.  The bathroom, as expected from a guest room, has a curved design from the outside. The inside is neatly organized with white tiles. The bathtub is also a very large circular bathtub, and it takes a while to fill. It\u0027s great for kids to play in the water. Amenities are from L\u0027Occitane, and the soap is from Donggu Ban. Himalayan pink salt is provided for the bathtub. Across from the bathtub is a dressing room with the best view I\u0027ve ever seen in a hotel. The space is spacious, so you can hang a lot of clothes, and the robes and slippers are lovely. Looking at the view from the Junior Suite, you might think this is a good room. But let\u0027s take a look at the most basic room, the Deluxe Room. The Galaxy Room has two views: mountain and river. Let\u0027s start with the mountain view. As expected, it\u0027s all white. The 42-square-meter room is neither too small nor too large, but just right. The unique feature is the long sofa opposite the bed instead of a TV. I visited during the fall foliage season, and the mountain view was just as stunning as the river view. However, the window was fogged, making it less cool. The bathroom, while small, is clean and better than the Junior Suite.  It has a bathtub and is connected to the bedroom, so it does n\u0027t feel stuffy. The Philux River View has the same structure as the Mountain View, but it has a luxurious Han River view facing the Han River straight ahead. Let \u0027s also take a look at the suites at Vista Walkerhill. The Studio Suite is one of the rooms with the most spacious view of Achasan Mountain. With an area of ​​70 square meters, it feels much more spacious than the Junior Suite. The bathroom has two sinks, and the view of Achasan Mountain is special. Of course, you can hide them with a curtain, so do n\u0027t worry. The Spot Suite is an incredible suite with a view of the Han River that can beat the spa. Only the Spot Suite has a gray floor and a dark-colored bathtub for enjoying the spa. The sink, shower booth, and toilet are open in the space where the spa is located. The living room and bedroom are separated by a wall on the inside. Even from the spacious living room, you can only enjoy the open Han River view. However, the bedroom is located on the inside and has no separate window. Finally, the Corner Suite is an upgraded version of the Junior Suite. It is located in the corner, but the room size is nearly twice that of the Junior Suite. The room is larger, so it has more windows, so the view is great. This is the best room I\u0027ve ever seen. Think of it as an additional space with a dining table in front of the spacious living room compared to the Junior Suite. Now that you\u0027ve seen the white, open Vista Walker room, how about a traditional Grand Walkerhill room? The most basic room at Grand Walkerhill, the Standard Room, has no view, but the Deluxe Room and above have views of the Han River or Achasan Mountain. Among them, the Deluxe and Club Deluxe are exactly the same room, but the Club Villa is located on the upper floor and has access to the club lounge. Let\u0027s take a look at the Club Deluxe Han River View Room that I stayed in. The room is 30 square meters, which is smaller than the basic room at a typical 5-star hotel. Looking out the window and seeing the bed in the center reminds me of the Deluxe Room at The Plaza near Seoul City Hall Station. Both are old hotels, so they seem to have structural limitations. However, the Deluxe Room at Grand Walkerhill doesn\u0027t overdo the design, giving it a comfortable feel. The padding-patterned walls give it the feel of a wooden mountain lodge. The side wall was hollowed out, giving it a simple yet transformed look.  I feel like they did their best within the available conditions, using sophisticated lighting without being excessive. While it\u0027s narrow, the Han River view is outstanding. However, Grand Walkerhill is further from the Han River than Vista Walkerhill, and there\u0027s a building in the middle, which is a bit disappointing. However, there\u0027s nothing to obstruct the view. The TV is mounted high on the wall to avoid obstructing the view. The bathroom is also small, so there\u0027s no separate space; you shower in the tub. Products from the American drugstore brand Kobiglow and Donggu bar soap are provided. Flaphyllax is also available, offering complimentary drinks and snacks in the refrigerator. If you want a room that\u0027s not cramped while eating at Grand Walkerhill, you should definitely choose a suite. There are several options, including the Deluxe Suite with a separate living room and bedroom, and the Family Deluxe Suite with two beds, perfect for families. Let \u0027s take a closer look at the Vegan Suite, which I really liked for its clean concept and design. The \"Vegan\" in the Vegan Suite refers to the veganism we practice. The actual rooms are designed to exclude animal products and minimize environmental impact.  The lush greenery and the soft green carpet and furniture on the walls create a truly luxurious feel. Riding the cycle in one corner of the room actually generates electricity to light the room, so it might be a good idea to try it for some exercise. Grand Walkerhill is located further back than similar Walkerhills, so while the parking lot is visible, it\u0027s still a nice place to admire the beautiful scenery. The Royal Suite, the hotel\u0027s third-best room, is 110 square meters. Unlike the Galaxy Room, the Grand Walkerhill Suite has a very luxurious feel with its vibrant color tones and furniture textures. If you prefer a more refined and sophisticated style rather than a modern feel, the Grand Walkerhill Suite might be a better fit than the Vista Walkerhill. However, many of you will likely find the Grand Walkerhill\u0027s basic deluxe rooms disappointing, and I\u0027m no exception. However, Grand Walkerhill has one room to spare: the Grand Club, a club lounge. If you book a room with a club fee included, the Grand Club on the 15th floor offers access to a high-end restaurant with a stunning view, thanks to the large windows that fill both sides. Enjoy the most beautiful views of the Han River and Mount Acha from the hotel.  There is a space where you can enjoy tea time, happy hour, and breakfast the next day, just like Yeonol Lounge. During tea time, a few simple cookies, fruit sandwiches, and coffee were provided. What surprised me was that the food served during the hour was of a very high standard. There were three kinds of desserts, including lamb trotters, mango shrimp, grilled chicken wings, and meatballs, as well as fruit and cake. With cheese and ham from the salad corner, I think the lounge food alone would be in the top five in Seoul. The breakfast had a variety of breads, and the salads and hams that would be good for breakfast were delicious. Although it was n\u0027t as good as the main breakfast buffet, I definitely enjoyed the meal. In fact, I would say that the lounge made up for the disappointment I had with the room. The space is great, and the food is well-composed and of excellent quality. If you want a food vacation, I highly recommend this hotel. On the other hand, Vista Walkerhill doesn\u0027t have a club lounge, but it has a secret weapon: Skyard. Skyard, created in collaboration with world-renowned plant hunter Seijun Nishiata, has an outdoor space with a view of the Han River decorated with various plants and sunbeds. Above all, there is a foot bath where you can soak your feet while spacing out.  It\u0027s a masterpiece. Similar to Walkerhill\u0027s herbivore plan, anyone can use it for free. How about the swimming pool and fitness center operated by Grand [Music]? The swimming pool and fitness center at Grand Walkerhill are located on the second basement level, so there\u0027s no view. The swimming pool has brick pillars, lattice doors on the ceiling, and mirrors, giving it a luxurious feel, typical of Grand Walkerhill. The depth is 1.2 meters and gradually deepens, which is nice. There\u0027s also a shallow children\u0027s pool on one side. The fitness center is equipped with Technogym equipment, but it\u0027s not very spacious and not very pretty, which is a bit disappointing. On the other hand, Vista Walkerhill\u0027s swimming pool has a high ceiling and floor-to-ceiling windows, offering an unobstructed view of the Han River. The photo was taken at dawn, so the outside view isn\u0027t included, but it \u0027s definitely a great swimming pool for taking pictures and full of emotion. The fitness center is also spacious, has a variety of equipment, and has a great view. The Walkerhill Library on the second floor has over 3,000 domestic and international books, making it a great place to enjoy reading. The outdoor Forest Park, which children will enjoy, offers outdoor activities like camping. River Park, another seasonal outdoor swimming pool, is one of the few in Seoul with an international- standard main pool. It\u0027s a large outdoor pool that\u0027s not open yet. There \u0027s also a tennis court that can be used with a reservation. Finally, let\u0027s take a look at the breakfast and other restaurants. Regardless of where you stay at Grand Walkerhill Vista Walker, breakfast is served at The Biffé located on the second floor of Grand Walkerhill. On weekends or when there are many guests, main dishes are also served at El Vino on the first floor of Vista Walkerhill. The food is the same, but the view is better at Del Vino, so it\u0027s better to use Del Vino. The main dishes are excellent. As Walkerhill operates various sigma restaurants, I think the service is excellent from the lounge to the breakfast. There are window seats for the initiation ceremony, but the view isn\u0027t particularly great, so there\u0027s no need to go early to make a reservation. The hotel\u0027s most famous sigma restaurant is Pizza Hill. It \u0027s a building that\u0027s been around since the hotel was first built in 1963, and it\u0027s famous for its pizza while enjoying the view in the middle of the Achasan forest. You can also get a discount and order takeout from Bakery Pass Aju in the lobby of Grand Walkerhill. Honestly, it\u0027s a bit of a stretch to get a pizza at this price without the advantage of a good location. The pizza was delicious, but...  The value for money was really poor. In addition, Grand Walkerhill has the Korean restaurant Ondal, the Chinese restaurant Geumryong, and Vista Walkerhill has the Italian restaurant Del Vino, the Japanese restaurant Moaek, and the famous DJ and cocktail bar Rebar. Also worth checking out is Myeongwolgwan, a Korean beef charcoal grill restaurant with a traditional Korean house interior and an outdoor garden overlooking the Han River. So, what\u0027s your overall review of the Walkerhill Hotel? It\u0027s a well-balanced hotel that I\u0027d love to visit often if it were a little closer. The hotel is located on the eastern edge of Seoul, inside Acha Mountain, so accessibility is quite limited. While there\u0027s a shuttle, it\u0027s also quite inconvenient to use public transportation. Having to drive a long way from downtown Seoul to enjoy a vacation is a bit of a burden. However, its distance from downtown Seoul can be an advantage. It occupies a vast site within Acha Mountain, so while it\u0027s far from the city center, the air is fresh and it feels like you\u0027re in a church. As it\u0027s located in a world-class hotel, there are plenty of walking and jogging trails here and there. It \u0027s a great hotel for those who want to escape the city and heal but don\u0027t have the luxury of traveling far.  If I were to evaluate Vista Walkerhill on its own, it would be a hotel that offers clear river and mountain views and a modern feel, making it a great choice for younger travelers. However, the guestroom interior feels a bit dated. Chasing trends can feel out of place and outdated over time. Not only does it offer a swimming pool and fitness center, but it also boasts a unique Sky Lounge, a feature unique to Walkerhill. This hotel is also recommended for those who prioritize amenities. On the other hand, the standard guestrooms are a bit cramped and the interior design is disappointing. However, the club lounge\u0027s space and food quality are excellent, making it a great choice for vacationers. If you\u0027re planning to stay in a suite, the Grand Walkerhill Suite might be a better option than the similar Walkerhill in terms of design. I personally really like the balance between the guestrooms and amenities, so I\u0027d love to visit again next spring for a vacation and some cherry blossom viewing.

{"video_id":"VM0ZkKk0aaM","lang":"en","full_text":"JW Marriott Seoul, famous for being a 5-star hotel representing the Banpo and Seocho areas, towering over the Gangnam Express Bus Terminal. There is talk that JW Marriott, the top luxury brand among Marriott hotels in Korea, has changed too much recently. What has changed? Let\u0027s find out together with 1g, the representative 5-star hotel in Gangnam, and leaving again today. [Music] Hello, I\u0027m also a man. JW Marriott is a luxury hotel brand that was first created in 1984, named after the recollection of the founder of Marriott Corporation, Wella Lim Elliott. In Korea, it opened in 2000 when Centro\u0027s City opened at the site of the Honam Express Bus Terminal. In 2012, Shinsegae acquired Central Seat, the owner of the hotel, and it is currently operated by the Shinsegae Group. In fact, Chung Yoo-kyung, the president of Shinsegae Department Store, led the hotel renovation that took place for about 8 months in 2017. This year, we used the JW Marriott Seoul. This is the result of innovation at the time with the concept of luxury on a different level. Thanks to this, JW Marriott Seoul has a special feel right from the hotel lobby. While most hotels have a front desk for check-in on the first floor lobby, JW Marriott Seoul has an art exhibition like an art gallery. In fact, the Ivory Width Necklace in the center is the work of French artist Jean- Michel Waterniel, and it is said to be made by weaving 500 12-bead glass beads imported from Murano Island, Italy. Instead of making the first floor lobby like a gallery that anyone can use, the product desk was moved to the 8th floor. In the case of guests staying in executive rooms including those with a 0, check-in is done at the executive lounge on the 9th floor. However, the 8th floor lobby is decorated much more regularly than the executive lounge. Although it is small in size, the ceiling is high to avoid feeling stuffy, and it is a space that stands out for its class and sensibility with a wrinkled pink cut feeling. In addition to the visual aspect, there are many things to see throughout the hotel.  An echo system is installed so that you can feel the signature scent of the JW Marriott brand, Stone Sophist TK, and through professional curation, we can provide you with detailed BGM that highlights the characteristics of the establishment. The hotel rooms are divided into four types depending on whether they include a bed and whether they include a deluxe room for general guests. There are actual grill pan suites, king suites, kitty suites, web business suites, and the best room type is the penthouse. There is a lounge in front of the general room, and Nick asked about the Executive Deluxe King 2509 after that. When you enter the room, let\u0027s get ready. JW Marriott Seoul has a view of the Han River and a hospital facing Gangnam St. Mary\u0027s Hospital. If you\u0027re lucky, you might get a Han River view even in a general deluxe room, but it\u0027s better not to expect too much. If you really want a Han River view, you can pay an additional fee to secure a high-rise Han River room. The reason why a high floor is important is because even if it\u0027s called Han River B, it\u0027s wet.  In this case, it\u0027s because the rooftop of Shinsegae Department Store looks narrow. Then, what about the view of the Han River from the 15th floor of Tuscany? Well, the Han River is clearly visible. However, it\u0027s true that it feels a bit bleak because apartments are built along the Han River. Especially on the day I visited, the fine dust was so bad that I could barely see Namsan Tower. The room was a good size and the interior was decent. The dark brown wooden floor, partially covered with purple carpet, and the pink mood went well together, but the headboard that seems to wrap around the bed is unique. It \u0027s a design that people love, but I think it reminds me of a forest fire. It\u0027s a standard separate care mv, and the Simmons Beautyrest line, also known as the hostess bed, is on the floor. The pillows are very soft and my friend liked them. The large relaxing sofa next to it is also impressive. It\u0027s not common for Gibong rooms to have such a long sofa. It\u0027s comfortable to stretch out your legs, and there\u0027s also a round table, which was great for eating. Across from the bed is a 55-inch raised bed.  There\u0027s a TV, and it\u0027s unique that there\u0027s a picture of a Baek Hanok printed in front of it. The furniture for storing luggage is made of dark marble, which is also used in the bathroom interior. When you open the white sliding door and enter, there\u0027s a bathroom. Unlike the bathrooms that are often divided into separate areas these days, the JW Marriott Seoul feels like it uses the entire space as one. The white marble and dark marble intersect to create a warm and inviting feel, which is not so much of a modern experience as it is of a wealthy home from the past. A flower pot in one corner really gave it the feel of a home bathroom. The amenities are a collaboration between global cosmetics manufacturers E-COSMAX and Shinsegae Chicor for the JW Marriott. The body lotion with the Marvenor scent is excellent. Bath salts are also provided in the wooden bathroom, which is a nice touch. The separate shop has wooden floors and grab bars for those with mobility issues. Mini laundry capsules, coffee, and tea are available, but it\u0027s unique that the Premier Sting T-Wand is provided instead of the D-100. The teacups are also available.  The Korean ceramics are from Ocean Bless from Thailand. Overall, the rooms have a luxurious, heavy, and old-fashioned feel. They are more restored than the Shilla Hotel or Grand Hyatt Seoul, which have a longer history. I think the color of the marble used in the rooms and at the head of the bed is the influence. Given the hotel\u0027s location, I think the main target audience is older people rather than young people. The main reason why people say that JW Marriott Seoul is not what it used to be is because of the one-time Executive Lounge on the 9th floor. In the case of the Visual Lounge, there was afternoon tea during the day, a light meal in the evening, a dessert time with happy hour and dessert, an evening cocktail made by a bartender, and even breakfast. However, currently, the service has been significantly reduced in the name of infection prevention and spread prevention. First of all, afternoon tea itself has disappeared. Instead, dacquoise, macarons, and drinks are served from 2 p.m. onwards, and all self-service is available. In fact, even the Osaka Port Lanseon Afternoon Tea alone often fills up to 6 people, so you can also have lunch.  I rarely eat out, but since afternoon tea is almost non-existent, I had no choice but to visit the lobby lounge on the 8th floor and have three rounds of dim sum. I previously introduced the afternoon tea set at the JW Marriott Saul\u0027s 8th floor lobby lounge, and the dim sum trio was just as good. Including the premium Chinese tea, there were a total of seven kinds of tea, including the Kim Seon-mi Nao Han-Tan shrimp and Anton Myeong. These two people were able to eat to their hearts\u0027 content. I waited for happy hour to console myself from the afternoon tea in the lounge. Fortunately, Pia One had several kinds of half-do. For the main course, there was chicken and steak, and for the main course, there was always halibut grilled in cream sauce and salmon. In addition, there was pasta, fried rice, two bowls of simple Korean side dishes, and bibimbap. Unfortunately, because the lounge was so crowded, there were often empty plates, and the meal flow was constantly interrupted. I felt like I had already promised all 10 main courses, and instead, I filled my stomach with pasta, butterfly, bulgogi, and rice. For alcoholic beverages, there were red and white wines.  Two types of beer and one type of sparkling wine were prepared, and it was nice that they had a variety of cocktail bases available. In the case of Happy Bottom, it didn\u0027t feel like the lounge level had dropped compared to before, but the one-hour time limit was the biggest blow. It was recently featured on the arrogant JW Marriott Hotel\u0027s home shopping program, and the lounge was so crowded that I had to wait for more than 30 minutes during dinner time, and it was disappointing that it felt like a flea market and that the food wasn\u0027t served well. In the case of the Shilla Hotel lounge that I visited recently, I waited for an hour and a half, but it did n\u0027t feel crowded at all when I actually used the lounge. It felt like they were limiting the number of people for a comfortable use. However, the JW Marriott Hotel received too many guests compared to the number of people in the lounge, and it felt like they couldn\u0027t even operate the lounge at full capacity. The lounge breakfast was a wellness breakfast for 4 people. You know you have to order small food to make it a place, right? It \u0027s a simple breakfast, but the bakery was so good that I, a bread lover, failed to enjoy it. Let\u0027s stop looking around and now take a look at the portable fitness club that JW Marriott is proud of. The Marquis Spa Fitness Club, located on the second basement level, is different in size.  It overwhelms hotels. It is said that 352 pieces of shoulder exercise equipment are installed in a total area of ​​14,212 square meters. It is really big. In particular, you can see the swimming pool through the open space in the center, and there is an 85-meter-long jogging track around it, which is great for those who like to walk. There are six swimming pools, each 25 meters long, of Raymi. The swimming pool with a gym is not a pretty space for taking pictures with a hotel feel, but rather feels like a large professional sports center. Those looking for hotel gamification will probably know, and if exercise is the main purpose, it will be okay. Then, what is the overall review of the JW Marriott Seoul? How is it that love is not a change in service? Given the current situation, it is natural for services to change for quarantine purposes, and I think it is good for the guests. However, it was so crowded that it seemed impossible to come out and use the time for quarantine. I wondered if there were too many first-time customers compared to the lounge\u0027s capacity. With so many people, the service level is bound to go down. Not only that.  I\u0027ve seen cases where the usage time or seat spacing was adjusted for quarantine purposes, or replaced with a drink service, but it\u0027s rare for a service to be completely eliminated, such as eliminating the after-hours key itself. Recently, when JW Marriott Saul was featured on a home shopping channel, many people were attracted to it, saying that they could use the service of a 5-star hotel at a low price, but since the service has been reduced, I don\u0027t think it will turn out as I thought. The rooms may also vary depending on taste, but personally, I was disappointed with the old feeling, and I think it\u0027s a shame in many ways that it can\u0027t stand shoulder to shoulder with the best hotels in Seoul, which are often talked about.

I\u0027m a man who has left again until now, and I\u0027ve gained another chance to leave. Thank you."}

If you plan to come to Korea, I think you are very likely to come to Seoul because Seoul is a capital city and it\u0027s a big city and has a lot to offer. So, when you plan to go to Seoul, you have to think about accommodations, right? Where to stay? But you might feel, oh no, it\u0027s very overwhelming because soul is such a big city and it\u0027s hard to pick a hotel. Yes, picking an accommodation can be stressful and can be difficult. Oh, by the way, I have done two videos on where to stay in Soul. Of course, you can watch the videos too, but for now, to ease your burden, I have picked four hotels in Soul that are very great. yet affordable, reasonable for what they offer. Well, affordability can be relative, but we all can agree that some prices are so ridiculously expensive and you know, you don\u0027t want to pay that expensive for hotels, right? Some hotels are extremely expensive, but I have ruled out those hotels and I have picked four hotels. They are so great yet have great value. I have considered how great it is and how newly it is built, how great the review is about the hotel and also how easily accessible to public transportation. So you want to know what those four hotels are. So let\u0027s begin. Four hotels that are so great yet affordable. Ready? Go. Number one, Sophieel Ambassador Hotel. Well, this hotel is one of the most talked about and one of the most popular hotels today in Korea since it\u0027s opening in 2020. Yes, it\u0027s pretty new. It has been the talk of the town and people love to go to the restaurants in the hotel and of course customers love to stay in the hotel. It has a lot of great reviews and one of the customers said it is the best hotel he has ever been to. He has been to over 30 countries and he said he has gone to so many hotels and he loved this one the most. Well, it depends on the person. But anyway, I wanted to share this kind of review. Well, their service and their facility and their impeccable decor. Yes, those things are appealing to customers and people seem to love the hotel. I love Sophie hotels because they have usually great decor and the one in Korea is not an exception. As you may have known already, Sophie is an international luxury hotel brand that originated in France in 1964. And this one in Seoul opened in Chamshi. Chang is a rich residential area in southern Soul and it\u0027s a very peaceful and it\u0027s a very familyfriendly area and there are lots of things to do in the hotel. You can enjoy great spa and great swimming pool and of course their restaurants are good. But other than the hotel, yes, you are within walking distance of the Rot Tower, the tallest building in Korea, 123story building and Rot World, the country\u0027s biggest indoor amusement park. And you can go to shopping malls nearby. And of course, public transportation is wonderful. as you are close to subway line two and subway line 9 so you can get to other parts of the city easily well is not exactly in the city center so if that\u0027s a problem for you maybe this is not right for you but actually as I said the public transportation and its accessibility are great so I think you wouldn\u0027t have a problem staying there in addition it\u0027s very easy to get there from the airport you can take an airport limazine bus that goes direct directly to the hotel to the Chamsil area. So, it\u0027s easy for you to go from the airport to the hotel and vice versa. So, anyway, this hotel has more than 560 rooms and in front of the hotel you have a beautiful lake called Sukchun Lake. In the morning, you can stroll around the lake and in the afternoon you can explore the Chamir area or you can go to other parts of the city and at night you can end your day at the 32nd floor. Roof bar. Yes, there is a fantastic roof bar in the hotel. Yes. And you\u0027re going to end your day perfectly there. And the view of skyines you can see from the bar is great. And if you stay in one of the rooms that have lake view, I think your stay will be more enjoyable. So anyway, you get the sense. It\u0027s a very luxurious five-star hotel and it offers everything you can think of. So if you want to stay in a very luxurious hotel, Ambassador\u0027s Hall would be a good option. Number two, Mandrean Hotel, Itwan. Yes, Mandrean Hotel is also an international brand, right? on this one in Itan a very vibrant area in Soul. This is the first Mandrean hotel in Asia. Yes, they built this hotel for the first time in Asia. And since it\u0027s opening in 2020, yes, this is also a newly built hotel. It has been very popular on SNS. People go there because they want to see the impressive decor of the hotel. Yes, this hotel is very beautiful. And as soon as you step into the lobby, you\u0027re going to be aed by the interior design. It has a lot of plants and LED and has a lot of luxurious sofas and everything. It\u0027s ceiling is very high. And I love the decor of the hotel. This hotel, I first got to know this hotel because my friend had a wedding in this hotel. Wow. When I went to the wedding hall, it was so beautiful. And after the wedding, my friend had a after wedding party on their rooftop bar. Yes, their rooftop bar is fantastic as well. And if you go there when the sun goes down, wow, the view is very beautiful there. Yes, it\u0027s such a beautiful hotel in and out. And their outdoor swimming pool is very popular and a lot of Koreans love to go there because it has such a great ambiencece. So, it\u0027s a popular destination and they have good restaurants. So, you can go there to enjoy the food as well. And you\u0027ll never get bored because you are in Itan. Itan is one of the vibrant neighborhoods in Korea. A lot of restaurants, bars, and cultural scenes. And you are also close to the National Museum of Korea and also Hanang Han River. So you are close to the nature and the history and the vibrant neighborhood Ewan. And it\u0027s actually located in the center. So you can go to the south of Soul or North of Soul easily and other tourist attractions too. You\u0027re of course close to subway station line number six. So you can get to many parts of the city easily if you stay there. poshi hotel, but it\u0027s affordable compared to other luxurious hotels. You can check it out yourself and I will leave the link in the YouTube description. Okay. Number three, Rescape Hotel. Well, if you are coming to So Mhm. and you are searching for information, you should know Maongdong, right? Maongdong is a popular touristy area and a lot of tourists go there. A lot of people are looking for accommodations near Maongdong or in Maongdong. There are lots of hotels too to some extent. Oh, they look almost similar. I mean, we can easily expect what a modern hotel room looks like. But this one, Lascape Hotel is totally different from what you have thought of a hotel room in Maongdong. It stands out because it\u0027s a decoration. Yeah, I\u0027m talking about decoration again because I think design is what makes a difference too. And anyway, landscape hotel is so different from other hotels and it stands out. Well, you are in Maongdong Soul in central soul, but you would feel like you are in Paris, right? It\u0027s like a boutique hotel in Paris. When they first opened their hotel in 2019, what they focused was to design a hotel that was inspired by the 19th century Parisian sensibilities. Yes. And then they decorated their rooms with intense colors and antique furniture. So you can check out the photos of the hotel. And if this is not your type, maybe you can pass the hotel. But if you like this kind of hotel, if you\u0027re looking for something special and unique and you want to be centered in Maongdong or in central Soul, well, this could be your thing. The rooms are decorated very beautifully and their restaurants have great reviews, too. Especially the Chinese restaurant has been awarded many times. So, you can try the Chinese restaurant if you like Chinese food. So, let\u0027s talk about the location. You are in central soul and of course you\u0027re close to Mongdong walking street and also you are next to Shinsi department store and lute department store two of the country\u0027s biggest department stores and also you\u0027re close to Nam Moon market and an Soul Tower where you can see a great view of Soul day and night. So it\u0027s a good place to base yourself to explore the center of soul fully. So if you are into this kind of boutique hotel and has different ambience, I think you would love less hotel. Actually this is loved by locals and tourists too and they have great reviews. So check it out. Number four, last but not least is Rise Autograph Collection Hotel in Hungai. You know, Hungai, Hungai is a very popular neighborhood in Soul and a lot of people love to go there. They have trendy bars, trendy cafes, restaurants, and shops. Yes, they have lots of cute shops. Their prices are very reasonable and good. A lot of people, especially young people, love to explore the area and hang out there. So anyway, Hung area has a lot of hotels. But the reason I picked this one is that this has been internationally recognized. Yes. And then it has great reviews and its interior design is very unique. It opened in 2018 2018 and then it was one of the top 50 hotels on the British magazine Monaco. the words picked because the hotel\u0027s design was so innovative and creative. Yes, they loved the magazine loved the design and I love the design too. And you might say she\u0027s talking about the design a lot, but actually hotels can be very similar, but what makes the difference is the design of the hotel, right? This one is very artistic. It actually has an art gallery in the basement and it holds a lot of cultural events and it wants to showcase street culture and also high-end cultures. You can see a lot of paintings and very impressive interior design in the lobby. The high ceiling and the luxurious posi sofas and beautiful lights and then each room and each floor they are designed differently. So you can tell how much efforts they have put into designing the hotel. So this hotel is in Hung and its location is great and the hotel itself is great. So it\u0027s very popular. It has more than 270 rooms. But if you want this hotel, you need to hurry up a little bit because it\u0027s filled up quickly. Uh compared to other hotels, of course, you can use public transportation easily. You are steps away from subway line 2 and moreover the airport express train called ax goes to hungai station. So you can go to hung station from the airport straight and then you can walk to your hotel from the train station. Wow. Yes. That\u0027s very convenient, right? And they have a great rooftop bar. So if you go there during the evening, wow, the sunset is beautiful over Hungang Han River. So if this appeals to you, you can check it out. I\u0027ll leave the link to this hotel in the YouTube description. [Music] Okay. Okay. So, I have picked four hotels. They are luxurious, great, yet affordable.

{"video_id":"-BNe9BBM-SA","lang":"en","full_text":"As summer approaches, many of you will be looking for a cool ocean view resort.   Let\u0027s find out with Ttottonam where that place, which boasts a hot ocean view that is called a children\u0027s paradise, is located. [Music] Hello.  I\u0027m a man again, a man again . Geoje Belvedere, which we will introduce today, is located on Geoje Island, the second largest island in Korea and a place that preserves the beauty of other countries. Belvedere is an Italian word meaning beautiful view . As its name suggests, it is a place that embraces the quiet and beautiful Mongdol Beach of Geoje Island .  Everdeer can be found right after crossing the Geoga Bridge between Busan and Geoje Island .  In fact, some rooms offer not only an ocean view, but also a stunning view of the Geoga Bridge. Elbury was built with a total area of ​​27,800 pyeong and a total investment of 270 billion won .  A total of 400 rooms, this is a massive resort with an indoor recovery marina lounge with an infinity pool and the largest kids\u0027 facility in Gyeongnam .   The lobby was as large and spacious as the scale. It serves as a central hub connecting the two West and East buildings.  The ocean view beyond the window was spectacular, and unlike other ocean views, Belvedere\u0027s ocean view was unique to Geojedo Island in that it showed the sea, mountains, and islands all at once .  The rooms are largely divided into Deluxe Suite and Royal Premier Suite, and there are also Pororo-themed rooms that children will love.  The first room we will see is the upper-floor premium room called the Premier Suite. As soon as you enter the room, a spacious living room and kitchen appear. It is a clean resort room with a simple, uncomplicated feel that gives off a sense of the ocean.  Although cooking is not allowed, there is a dining table where you can bring your own food and a spacious living room where the whole family can sit together, which is a huge plus for families traveling together.   The new meat added here and there makes it feel even more special. Since it was a room on the upper floor with a great view, the view from the balcony was really refreshing. Most rooms at the Belvedere, including the Premier Suites, have outside balconies, allowing you to enjoy the cool sea breeze. There are two bedrooms in total.   The main bedroom with king-size bed is located inside.  The bright wood feel and bedding colors give it a resort-like feel.  The main bedroom is also connected to the bathroom.   I especially like that there is a bathtub with a view so you can bathe while looking out the window. Aveda products are also provided in the Premier Suite.  The second bedroom is connected to the living room and has two twin beds. As this is a room for 4 people in the garden, there is a separate bathroom at the entrance so you can use it without any hassle. In fact, the Premier Suite room is a room that can only be reserved by those with a separate membership, so it has been difficult for the general public to use it . This year, some Premier Suite rooms are said to be available for general reservations as well.   You ca n\u0027t miss it while it\u0027s good, right?  Standard rooms are divided into Royal, Suite, and Deluxe .  Let me show you the best royal room first .   The Royal Room is even larger than the Premier Suite in terms of room size .  In fact, hotels can sometimes feel a bit stuffy when traveling with family, but resorts like Beaverdeer have the advantage of being able to relax comfortably without feeling stuffy at all.  There are two bedrooms, one inside the living room and one to the right of the entrance. Both rooms are well-lit and neatly decorated.  There are also two bathrooms, and the main bathroom has a bathtub. However, the view from the bathtub is not an ocean view.  The rooms also have spacious balconies surrounding them.  The suite rooms, one level below, are smaller than the royal rooms .  There is a living room and kitchen of a reasonable size, so there is more than enough space for a family to comfortably use.  Best of all, in the Sweet Ocean View Room, you can choose to view Geoga Bridge in addition to Mongdol Beach . It\u0027s a special view that can only be seen from Devon.  It\u0027s not just the Geoga Bridge that you can see, but the mountains and the sea behind the resort are also visible.   If the view from the front of the resort, Mondore Beach, was exciting and had a summery feel, the view from Gwaga Bridge was a quiet, static view with only the sound of the wind blowing, so I personally really liked the view from Geoga Bridge . There are two bedrooms, one with a bed and one with an ondol-style floor heating, so it would be good for traveling with children or parents who would prefer an ondol-style floor heating than a bed .  There are two bathrooms, but no bathtub .  Lastly, the deluxe room located in the West Wing.  This is a basic room available at the most reasonable price .  Nonetheless, all rooms have ocean views.   It looks similar to a typical hotel room.  You\u0027ll notice that there are tables and chairs to sit facing each other for a moment .  It\u0027s also fun that there\u0027s a small desk and sink behind the bed . The sink is outside and the toilet and shower are separate. Overall, I felt that the rooms at Belvedere were spacious, clean, and practically decorated like a resort, making them a great choice for families . For family travelers, the rooms are important, but how well the water play facilities are equipped is also important.  Everdean features an indoor and outdoor pool on the 2nd floor, and an infinity pool on the 20th floor .  Above all, both pools are parallel to the sea, so when you swim, you feel like you are in the sea.  In particular, the infinity pool on the 20th floor is a unique charm that only Geojedo Island has.  It is the perfect place to enjoy the breathtaking view of the blue sea and the islands of Gungungun . Since it operates on a reservation system and is only available to adults, it is perfect for those who want to swim quietly.  Also, one end of the pool is transparent, so it feels like you\u0027re swimming in the sky, but it\u0027s also a little scary.  I highly recommend it to anyone who is ambitious about life. If you want to use it at a reasonable price, there are packages that include use of Infinity Park, so it would be a good idea to compare prices carefully.  The indoor/outdoor pool on the second floor is primarily for children.  Since it is located parallel to the sea, you can still get the feeling of an infinity pool even though the height is low .  It\u0027s quite large and has attractions that kids would enjoy, so I thought I\u0027d like to come here with my nephew.  The transparent floor I saw at the infinity pool on the 20th floor is also here.   It was impressive to see the children raising their hands excitedly.  The indoor swimming pool is also decorated in a unified style, so it does n\u0027t feel stuffy, and it\u0027s quite large, so it\u0027s great for kids to play in the water and feel the ocean vibe even when the weather is bad or in the winter .  In addition, the resort offers a wide variety of activities for children to enjoy .  Everdeer\u0027s Bounce Trampoline Park is a popular attraction among children, featuring trampolines and gym lines for them to enjoy .  In addition, there is the Pororo Kids Cafe, the Drawing Cafe where you can draw with your child, and Bring Live where you can play with My Pop-Up Lego blocks .  You may be wondering what I did for fun when I didn\u0027t have a child .  The landscaping in front of the resort is very well maintained, making it a great place for a walk. Ongdu Beach is also the resort\u0027s private beach, so it was quiet and nice to walk around.   You can also enjoy yacht sailing and on-board fishing at the marina, taking in the beauty of the Geoje sea. If you take a sunset cruise, you can enjoy a cool sea breeze and tour every nook and cranny of the resort and the Geoga Bridge for 1 hour and 10 minutes. Above all, the night view of the resort when you return to the pier is truly beautiful. Even if you don\u0027t go yachting, I highly recommend going to Marina Tras at one hour to see the night view .  In addition, there is a Bell Spa on the 3rd floor of the East Building.   The spa is much larger and better decorated than I thought .  There is also a family room where you can receive spa treatment together with your family, so you can create fun memories by receiving spa treatment together with your family .  Breakfast is served in two locations as the resort is large.  I used it on the 20th floor, Elfloor. Elfloor has a great view and is a nice space.  The buffet menu was pretty good considering the price.  In addition, there are various types of gold mining in the city.   I was very impressed by the Chidder Trass, which is located closest to the sea in the West Wing.  This means that you can taste a variety of fish, and you can taste premium seafood using Geoje Island\u0027s local ingredients .  Among them, the lunch omakase was truly special.  You can enjoy a shack view while looking out at the sea in a separate private space inside the establishment .  The food served was also made with seasonal ingredients unique to Geoje Island, and the taste was excellent. However, the atmosphere was also great as I ate while taking in the view of the sea and listening to the sound of the waves.  I highly recommend going when the weather is nice, you wo n\u0027t regret it .  In addition, there are various restaurants in Busan and Gyeongnam, such as Gourmet and Cafe Black Up Coffee, so you can comfortably take care of your meals within the resort.  We stayed at Geoje Belvedere for 2 days and 1 night and filmed without any rest, so it was really hard.  Once you go there, you get the feeling that it is a well-decorated family resort with plenty of things to enjoy.  But despite that, there are people who think that Haeundae is the best in the south.  So far, I\u0027ve reviewed all the Oseong hotels in Haeundae, but I\u0027ve never introduced a resort for families. Let\u0027s take a look at Hanwha Resort Haeundae, a place where you can enjoy family time at a reasonable price while enjoying a view comparable to that of a luxurious five-star hotel. Hanwha-ri Jotound is one of the best places to view Gwanghan Bridge, Busan\u0027s representative landmark .  I actually toured both the low-rise and high-rise ocean view rooms, and of course, the view of Gwanghan Bridge from the high-rise rooms was amazing.  Surprisingly, the view from the lower floors was great, as Gwanghan Bridge felt very close. Furthermore, because it\u0027s a resort, the basic room size starts at 4 people.  Usually, hotels charge extra for each additional person, or even if you pay, the maximum is three people, so resorts definitely have a big advantage for families .  Hana Resort Haeundae has three main room types: Family, Deluxe, and Royal.  First, let\u0027s take a look at the Royal Room, which is a good choice for large families traveling together.   The living room is huge and has large windows that offer a view of the beautiful Busan ocean.  There is a dining table and kitchen that can accommodate six people. Cooking is also possible, and simple cooking utensils and dishes are provided so you can prepare your own meals . There are two rooms in total.  The master bedroom is spacious with a bed and an ocean view .  Another room is an ondol room, so you can use it by laying down a prepared friend .  The bathroom is also clean.  If you are traveling with a smaller number of people, you may also want to consider a deluxe room .  It consists of one living room and one room .  Although smaller than the Royal Room, it has a living room and kitchen of a reasonable size .  The rooms at Hanwha Resort Haound are not overly fancy, but they are practical and neatly decorated. The advantage was that it had a great view that rivaled that of the nearby luxury hotels.   The resort\u0027s amenities include a sauna, where you can bathe while enjoying a 56-degree view that is as spectacular as the view of Gwanghan Bridge .  There is a convenience store and karaoke room in the basement .  Haeundae Hana Resort is close to both Haeundae and Gwanghalli, making it a great choice for exploring both beaches. Another great feature is the promenade that runs along the beach right in front of the resort . I also went jogging to Haeundae in the morning, and maybe because I\u0027m a country bumpkin from Seoul, I really enjoyed running while receiving the treatment.   There are many delicious restaurants around the resort, making it a great place to explore the city and try different restaurants. Furthermore, the resort has partnerships with various tourist destinations in Busan, so if you make a reservation through the resort, you can enjoy various facilities at discounted prices. Representative examples include Haeundae Blue Line Park, which is currently the hottest tourist attraction in Busan, Sunshine Ailing Knot, and X-the-Sky, the second-highest observatory in Korea, which you can use at discounted prices.   The food is served at the PCN Silside Kitchen located on the second floor .  Are the schematic prices real?  Even if the entire family uses it, it can be used at a reasonable price of less than 100,000 won.  That does n\u0027t mean the facilities or food quality are low.  The view is great and the food is clean, so you can eat your fill without feeling burdened .  But the restaurant I would personally recommend the most is Cloud 32, located at the highest point of the 32-story resort.   It is a luxurious and stylish place that is comparable to the Osung Hotel, with a cool and open view.  Actually, I thought that the restaurant with a view of the Gwanghan Bridge from a high-rise building was only available at a nearby hotel .  But that wasn\u0027t the case.  Plus, the price range is much more reasonable. Even though it was a dinner course paired with two glasses of wine, Cloud 32\u0027s signature course menu, the 56 Guy Course, was available for 120,000 won per person .  The course started with an amuse bouche and included grilled scallops, mushroom soup, live squid, risotto, lobster tail, and abalone.  For the main course, I had a choice between sirloin and tenderloin. The meat was tender and perfectly paired with a port wine sauce. Dessert and tea were also served. If you are traveling to Busan and are thinking of having a romantic dinner, I think this is the best choice in terms of atmosphere, value for money, and taste .  Also, Olivia, a cafe on the first floor famous for its atmospheric restaurant, recently reopened after renovation.   They say that on weekends, a market selling public offerings is held at the Cafe Barohapgongteo, so it might be a good idea to visit. So far, I\u0027ve introduced you to two resorts in the Gyeongsang region with great ocean views. If you want to have fun with your children in a quiet fishing village rather than a crowded city, Geoje Belvedere is the place to go. If you are traveling to Busan with your family and want to enjoy both a reasonable price and a great view, I recommend Hanari Jot Haeundae .

{"video_id":"y87bxy4y8nA","lang":"en","full_text":"a lot of people recommend hongdae myeongdong or kangnam is great places to stay in Seoul but my personal pick isn\u0027t among those three and I\u0027m about to take a deep dive into nine different areas in Seoul that are great to stay at so let\u0027s go there are so many good neighborhoods in Seoul to stay in depending on what type of traveler you are and in this video instead of just sitting down in my house talking to the camera let\u0027s actually go to each neighborhood and see what there is to do there what types of places there are to stay at and what type of traveler should stay there let\u0027s start in the Northwestern neighborhood of hongdae in the mapogu district and before we start you should know that most of the tourist places in Seoul are in the North Central chungnogu District so keep that in mind when you make your selection [Music] soul for young travelers to stay it only takes about an hour on the airport railroad from Incheon to hongdae it\u0027s just one Subway the whole way and it has two really different atmospheres depending on if it\u0027s day or night in the daytime there are tons of trendy restaurants cafes clothing shops gift shops anime stores arcades and a lot more for people to check out while staying here if you just think Korea\u0027s MZ generation you can probably picture what type of place this is and if it\u0027s the right fit for you foreign changes a lot at night time for sure there\u0027s a ton of nightlife out here and it\u0027s pretty loud at night too so it\u0027s something to consider when you\u0027re thinking of staying here on weekends the drinking can last until 7 8 A.M the next day no problem so if that\u0027s the kind of thing you\u0027re into it\u0027s definitely the perfect spot for that is there\u0027s a lot of bars and clubs and all that kind of stuff but if you\u0027re looking for kind of more of a quiet place at night it can be pretty loud here so it\u0027s definitely something to consider oh for places to stay there are hostels for about 15 to 25 dollars for a shared dorm and a lot of them are for people looking to party so they\u0027ll probably be pretty loud and wild just so you know however there are also some quieter hostels nearby so I just look at the reviews and pictures to find one best for you if you\u0027re on The Adventurous side and on the tightest of budgets you can always stay at a gym tibang or sauna which can be found all over Korea and don\u0027t require reservations the homegate 24-hour puga masauna is just over ten dollars for a night on weekends and even cheaper on weekdays but you\u0027ll be sleeping in a public area with other people so pack ear plugs in a sleeping mask if you have one if you\u0027re looking for something a bit more comfortable there are also nicer hotels in hongdae such as the L7 hotel or the Holiday Inn Express which are both really close to the subway station I\u0027d recommend these for young Travelers with a little bit of a bigger budget because they are more expensive at about 120 US dollars a night and to reserve a hostel or hotel in Korea I would just go to Google maps to find the best deals on different websites in your currency it seems to compare a lot of the popular websites to each other to find the best deal [Music] now let\u0027s go to shinton also in Northwestern Seoul just one subway stop away from hongdae or 15 minutes on foot shinchon definitely has more of a mellow Vibe than hongdae it\u0027s filled with University students from yonsei University which is one of the top universities in Korea and it has more of a Korean Vibe overall rather than being a touristy place there still are a lot of tourists here but a bit less than hongdae it\u0027s another great place for young people to stay laughs [Music] there\u0027s even a donkasu or pork cutlet place for this 3001 in absolute steal there\u0027s also the big Hyundai department store in the uplex which holds interesting events from time to time for tons of shopping catered towards young people and shinchon also has some great nightlife that\u0027s not as Club focused and more focused on Korean bars also called sujibs so shinchon has a lot of love motels as well which aren\u0027t as sketchy as they sound but they might not be the best place to travel as a family but luckily they are pretty cheap and they can go for about as low as 30 American so if you\u0027re on a budget they\u0027re a pretty good idea I\u0027ve stated a lot of them and they\u0027re not too bad if you don\u0027t mind spending more money they\u0027re also nicer hotels such as the H Avenue hotel which is closer to e day station for about 60 dollars an Ever eight service residence for just under a hundred dollars they\u0027re also a fair amount of guest houses here which seem to go as low as about 25 a night but some of the nicer ones can easily be over fifty dollars a night also one thing to note is these guest houses will have less of a party Vibe than hongdae and though be a little more relaxed overall so if you\u0027re a single traveler looking for more of a relaxed atmosphere this could be a really good place to stay [Music] now we have Seoul station and the nearby City Hall which is the most Central Point in Seoul that\u0027s closest on average to most tourist spots so you\u0027d think Seoul station will be one of the best places to stay just because it\u0027s so Central and the transportation is so convenient it is really easy to get to and from the airports from here with the airport express and there\u0027s also the KTX trains here which go all over the country like you can go to the east coast to a place like kangna or obviously Busan on the south east coast there\u0027s a few reasons why it\u0027s not the best place to stay although it is really convenient it is more slummy around here so probably not like the best place to walk around at night time especially for single Travelers or maybe if you\u0027re with a family or something you also get things like protests on the weekends there will be like hundreds of people around here there\u0027s a lot of religious groups and Cults and stuff like that the location is perfect but I definitely recommend other places to stay over Seoul station there are definitely some nice sites rounds such as the solo 7017 which is a walkway over Soul station that gives you a great view of one of the biggest intersections in Korea there\u0027s also sunnemun the gate to namde Moon that\u0027s the largest gate of its kind and then right beside City Hall Station you can find toksugum a Royal Palace from the joseon dynasty that was built in the 1400s and how\u0027s the Korean royal family until 1910 there are good facilities nearby such as grocery stores shopping and nice restaurants but I\u0027d only really recommend staying nearby to families who are looking to spend a bit more money on a nicer Hotel such as the Courtyard by Marriott which should be around 180 a night and is in a nicer area overall [Music] now let\u0027s go to it\u0027s strict [Music] so if they want is filled with water International food that\u0027s really hard to find in other places in Korea and there\u0027s also a lot of guest houses here and a pretty famous hotel but there\u0027s not a lot of motels here in general just a few here and there but it\u0027s a very famous place for travelers to come [Music] guest house is here about twenty to thirty dollars including Seoul Cube which looks like a mix between a capsule hotel and a guest house that looks pretty comfortable there are also hotels such as the Hamilton which can be booked for under a hundred dollars a night and is right next to the subway station etiwan comes to life at night time with a ton of bars and clubs that cater a lot to foreigners and tourists but I wouldn\u0027t strongly recommend staying here unless you have a strict diet such as requiring a lot of Halal or vegetarian options nearby however everyone has different needs and there are definitely a lot of people that prefer to stay in it Taiwan so it\u0027s hard not to put it on my list of areas to stay [Music] the next spot is myeongdong the shopping district also in central Seoul this is typically the most recommended area to stay online and for good reasons myeongdong has been a tourist spot in Seoul since the early 2000s it\u0027s been around forever and it\u0027s most known for its shopping to be honest there\u0027s a bunch of Cosmetics K-pop stores and that kind of stuff here it\u0027s also really close to another Market called namde Moon which pretty much sells everything so you\u0027re in a really central location if you stay here myeongdong is the spot for tourist hotels in Seoul if you\u0027re traveling alone and don\u0027t want to stay at a hostel where you have to interact with other Travelers this would be one of my recommendations just because of how many people are doing the same thing the hotels here range in price drastically from about forty dollars all the way up to over two hundred dollars so you can take your pick because there are just so many options and I don\u0027t really have any specific recommendations here one thing to note is there are guest houses here too but because of myeongdong\u0027s popularity they\u0027re similar in pricing to the tourist hotels myeongdong is also the most famous street food market at night with a lot of variety that\u0027s marketed mainly towards tourists and there\u0027s a good amount of international food around too with lots of Japanese and Chinese restaurants and even Din Tai Fung the famous Taiwanese chain [Music] foreign [Music] district with most of the traditional culture and the spot that I would personally stay in if I was coming to Korea for the first time so chungnoku includes places like kyung Palace pangomoon Square for ton hanok Village changiatan stream which is right behind me and then there\u0027s also insadong there\u0027s togehsa the Buddhist Temple and dongdaemun so there\u0027s a lot of tourist places around here for people to see if you stay nearby [Music] this is one of the coolest areas that\u0027s a complete mix between traditional and modern Korea you I just she\u0027s playing Changi in the Park which is Korea\u0027s version of Chess and then only a few blocks away you\u0027re in one of seoul\u0027s modern business districts chungnogu really captures the charm of Seoul the best especially for first-time travelers to see you can also find ixon dong here in older traditional hanok Village that\u0027s been completely transformed into a nice area with tons of restaurants and cafes at night time things come to life with the ujiro nogali Ali where you can enjoy nogare or Polak chicken and of course beer amongst Koreans in a bright and vibrant Alleyway with a really good atmosphere this is a place that you must go to if you\u0027ve never been before you can find guest houses for about 20 to 30 dollars with another Soul Cube Branch as well and if you\u0027re looking for hotels find just about anything you can think of from cheaper love motels starting all the way down at about thirty dollars to luxury hotels such as the Four Seasons for over five hundred dollars if I were to choose one area in chongnogu I\u0027d try and find a place near tungang or kwangamon station as you\u0027ll have the most central location in terms of things to see and eat Souls hipster song TSU neighborhood in the Northeast nicknamed The Brooklyn of Seoul so now that hongdae is known as kind of a big tourist area a lot of young people come here instead and a lot of shoe factories used to be here which have been turned into like cafes stores and restaurants you can tell it\u0027s really popular because there\u0027s a ton of people here for sure if you want to see how Korea\u0027s hipsters hang out Sun Tzu is the place to go Common Ground used to be one of the biggest landmarks here which is a bunch of containers piled up on top of each other to make a shopping mall but now the entire neighborhood has been transformed with the red brick shoe factor is being renovated into fancy cafes vintage clothing shops restaurants and even local breweries in fact it\u0027s gotten so trendy that some of the European fashion brands are starting to notice it too is not my style to be honest but for people that are really interested in how young fashionable Koreans do things I think it\u0027s really worth recommending there aren\u0027t as many hotels here as places like myeongdong or tongno but there are affordable options like the soul Forest stay for about 15 and then mid-tier options in the H Avenue hotel and hotel Poco which is right on the Main Street for less than a hundred dollars and then if you want to splurge you can stay near Kong University Station at the classic 500 pentas executive residence I\u0027d try to stay as close to seongsu station as possible as you\u0027ll be closest to everything and also walkable distance to the duxom Han River Park and Seoul Forest which is one of my favorite parks in Seoul thank you you\u0027ve probably heard of Gangnam from Psy\u0027s big hit Gangnam Style in 2012. it\u0027s in southern Seoul and is perfect for a very specific type of Traveler you\u0027re into fashion pretty little cafes and whatever is trendy on social media and kangnam is a place you should consider [Applause] [Music] there are so many amazing restaurants including some you might not expect a ton of plastic surgery clinics clothing stores and cosmetic stores in Gangnam and it has a bit more of an upscale Vibe than the rest of Seoul however it\u0027s pretty far away from a lot of the traditional culture in Northern Seoul so I\u0027d only recommend staying here if you just simply want to stay in Gangnam also despite being mostly a luxury neighborhood I managed to find a cheap hostel called ya Korea which is under 20 a night and there are also motels and hotels starting at about 45 dollars including the toyoko Inn for about fifty dollars which is one of my favorite hotel chains I\u0027ve ever stayed in because it kind of feels like you\u0027re staying in Japan and there\u0027s also a big breakfast buffet which is nice because a lot of places in Korea open so late and if you truly want to travel in luxury try staying at the joseon palace for about four hundred dollars a night [Music] and last but not least let\u0027s go to Southeastern Seoul and look at Jamshed is an area in Seoul inside the Lotte World Tower there\u0027s one of seoul\u0027s most expensive hotels called the signal so if you have the money for that that\u0027s a place you can stay it looks like there\u0027s really nice views in all the rooms I\u0027ll probably never get to check them in my life but maybe someday but it also has a lot of other things for travelers to do especially if you come as a family the Lotte World Tower is attached to the lotane World Mall one of the biggest malls in all of Korea which has tons of restaurants shopping for everyone of all ages in indoor and outdoor theme park called Lotte World adventure with a massive skating rink inside and a nice Lake to walk around for a stroll and not every hotel is as expensive as the signal such as the Lotte Hotel world for about 225 dollars a night which I think is really good for families and the hotel Lake for those on a tighter budget at about 75 dollars a night I wouldn\u0027t strongly recommend Cham show for single Travelers because you\u0027ll be so far out of the way but it might be worth checking out for a night or or two during your stay if you want to spend some time looking around and for travelers on a tighter budget there are also some love motels nearby for as cheap as 35 dollars within a five minute walk of the Lotte World Mall that\u0027s quite a steal for what you have access to to be honest [Music] stay in Seoul as you\u0027ve seen in this video Seoul has some really diverse neighborhoods all over the city suited to different types of Travelers and don\u0027t worry too much about accidentally picking the wrong neighborhood no matter where you end up staying you\u0027ll always be somewhat close to transportation to get around and you might just find some hidden gems that you would have missed out on if you didn\u0027t stay there remember to check out our playlist for Korean travel tips that will keep updating over time and if you like the video please press like and consider subscribing and joining our patreon if you have the financial flexibility to do so have a wonderful day and we\u0027ll see you soon

{"video_id":"-BQgS5gzwT0","lang":"en","full_text":"And okay, ah, yes, hello. What\u0027s up? Hanwoo is a refreshing menu item, but the current menu item is going to be a hamburger main menu item. And we\u0027re developing it with the concept of 5-day ink, Niki Dong. It wasn\u0027t as easy as I thought, so we\u0027re developing it now, and it\u0027s almost at the final stage, so let\u0027s see if the meat is suitable for Damyang 2. Oh, and lastly, we\u0027re going to change the breakfast a little this time. It \u0027s originally an American breakfast, but in fact, if it\u0027s an American breakfast, it\u0027s a continental breakfast with scrambled eggs or bacon sausage added. No matter how much you say it\u0027s an American breakfast, if you come and say, \"Why is there no kimchi? Why is there no rice?\" I\u0027d like to say that there would be a second season. In the accomplice, ID is not a full corruption, but an American breakfast. It seems like people keep misunderstanding this, so I just let it go, but as that demand builds up, we\u0027re going to reflect it, and I think it\u0027ll fly, so we\u0027re going to create a separate Asian station. So, we\u0027re creating a separate Asian station for the American breakfast, and there, we\u0027re going to have a simple bulgogi and one eye, rice.  Kimchi, this much, right? Listen, it seems like you\u0027ll be able to experience the Sen Sauce Hotel breakfast with the Asian section added. Listen. [Music] Uh, uh, we sold donuts briefly on the portal site in the past, but it was n\u0027t as easy as I thought, so we sold them for a long time and developed a new one this time. Also, we\u0027ve ambitiously prepared something. Personally, I think the Meiji is crazy dome. Deli B is old and 5 is for sale. 4. This is fruit Lee. And if you look at it based on the basics, the raspberry donut is a method. The star day donut base is baked in the oven, so you\u0027ll give it to me. Yes, what is salvation? It has a lot of this. Yes, I\u0027ve been watching it for a long time and I\u0027ve been riding it. This is really good, but the chae kami is a bit soft, so if you add pearl S, the color will become a bit stronger. Please show me when you sleep before launching. I ate all the mackerel before drinking. I felt the pearl texture right away. I saw it these days. What should I think? I\u0027ll take a look. The first vowel, what is it? Don\u0027t break it? Don\u0027t tell me. I have to take care of it. Just stay with what you receive. It\u0027s really good. I looked for it well and saw it. And I received it with ice cream. 2 But now, since we use ice cream properly, it\u0027s good, so this time, let\u0027s make sure, and you originally put it on top of the one without feet, or your wife will be the band\u0027s o, you can put no marshmallows in it, but I think those two yogurts, raw black pork, and you drink a little more, and beat the bell, and then 10 minutes, yes, now 2, you\u0027ve won, Siwon is finished, and the member of the National Assembly these days, Hatateko rice and the opening octopus feet are included like this, and let\u0027s look at the field of Dal Carol together, master, the second gift, package it like this and go home and see how much. I prepared three things now. I searched to express the curing, the lid, and the middle. What is it? 3. Cheese is for payment. I mixed the point cheese and made it quickly so that you can\u0027t see it. 4. * Look at the number. I just use that rice. Oak Lab is a bit symbolic, that is, to bring out the feeling, the same things go to the soft shell and approach. This is just a regular pipe. Just in case, these two free burgers are disliked, so I took a picture with my chest paired. [Music] 222 A little bit of Trom strength. Honestly, I\u0027ll try it. The sauce flavor seems a little weak. The professor\u0027s flavor seems weak, so please cut off all the points on the 4th floor of the legs that day. Later, usually, so at lunch, this guy is like the sun. I tested it and the chewy taste is like Park Jong-bae\u0027s fight. Also, how is it excellent? Like that chicken burger system? There are many vehicles, so it\u0027s cooked and I\u0027m counting the days for 5 minutes. Ugh, the original happiness is also the front view. It\u0027s better than the information on Ishitae in the US. 4 or 5. Shilla Five Guys. Since when I\u0027ve been earning money, it tastes like cheese. I think it\u0027s been 19 days. This is and I think it\u0027s a competition that leads to a face-off. Did the justification change after this inspection? Two skins, a fan, and a man. Onions are the product. I want perlite. It\u0027s good to maintain it well. Mochi is the amount. It\u0027s good for two women to eat together. A man\u0027s PC opening. Yes, wipe it like this. At the end, prepare it like that. I \u0027ll go like that. Ah, until then, just the basics. Go out to the bends.  Do you give perilla seeds? Special feature part 1 is coming soon. First, we will check if it is the same all the way, but next time, terrorism is a good man map free. Now, in my American breakfast, 9 rice and 3 kinds of pork bulgogi side dishes are added. Floss Gilchi is recorded. I think the added breakfast part will be really good for our motel guests who come in the future. And now, the bakery staff have experienced the restaurant\u0027s all-purpose meat menu, and I think it is really good that the staff make it themselves and sell it. It seems like a recurring fleet in reality. It seems like a restraint toy is created while watching, and I think it would be good for the staff to participate in the whole thing, so I plan to continue in the future. In this way, the test went well, and we wanted to show you that we are constantly developing new things and directly reflecting the direction by receiving dogs. And we are your ball now, our summer is the year of the comment. Anyway, the basic price is 2 parts. This is a bit of a wall of price for guests, so I was worried, but one of the biggest advantages of crab is its visuals. It is a huge pigeon. Yes, from our perspective, the visuals are important, but there are more.  People who have experienced it and come to me 1 I think that\u0027s more appropriate, so I changed it completely this time. I think it\u0027s about two-thirds of the existing amount, but we mainly used a credit card to down payment almost half of the amount. Mike was hospitalized for a day for an induced labor. So when he comes out, he\u0027ll be discharged and move to the postpartum care center where he can sleep. So, I\u0027ll try the postpartum care center where Tammy\u0027s belly is once. 1. I think it\u0027s a conversation between Jo, who lives in 10, and the breathing sound. But that \u0027s a postpartum care center in a hotel. So, I\u0027ll do a review to see what\u0027s different about the postpartum care center in the hotel. Yes, thank you. [Music] Uh"}

{"video_id":"-G8r9uAMFf8","lang":"en","full_text":"[Music] [Applause] and welcome to the St. Regis Red Sea. This is the first re resort to open over the water anywhere else other than the Maldes. I\u0027m so excited to show it to you. This is one of the coolest new resorts in the world. Welcome to the St. Regis Red Sea. [Music] And here we are at the Red Sea airport. This is one of the modes of transportation you can take is by helicopter. This is one of the coolest rides of my life. Let\u0027s check out this incredible resorts in the Red Sea, the Ritz Carlton in the St. Reges. [Music] All right, and here we are at our twobedroom Sunset Cora Villa. They said this is like the best one they have over the water. This is massive. It\u0027s a really cool design. Kind of like a sea shell almost. Just beautiful. But we\u0027re here at the end and the sun is actually setting now. So, I quickly want to take you outside to our beautiful terrace. They\u0027ve set up three bikes for us. So, we\u0027re ready to explore. We have the cool bracelet here that acts as the key card just like Numa. So, I\u0027ve got the Numa one and the St. Regis here. If you didn\u0027t see that video, be sure to watch it. Now, here we are heading into the beautiful room and right away you\u0027re greeted by the Florida ceiling window. This right away you can see the water which separates it a little bit from Njuma uh because that one it\u0027s not quite as Florida to ceiling windows like this St. Regis. All right. Now, real quick, we have a beautiful living area here. We went right in here first. They have a whole assortment set up for us just to thank us for our loyalty to Marriott and to welcome us to the resort. Just beautiful. We have a huge couch here, TV, and the floor to ceiling glass wraps all the way around, which is just really breathtaking to see all the water. Really beautiful. We can kind of look right down into the water. So, there\u0027s definitely a lot more viewing areas of the ocean. Just beautiful. We have a sliding door here. It\u0027s going to take us right outside on our beautiful deck. And this is amazing. We have This is the biggest deck. I got to tour an overwater villa at Numa. Be sure to watch it. But the deck there is very small and so is the pool. This one is massive. So we have this huge seating area over here. And then here we are the beautiful sunset right now. This is perfect timing. The crystal blue water. I\u0027ve never seen water this blue and beautiful anywhere in the world. Not Bali, not Hawaii, only here. Like this is amazing and you have to be here to see it. We\u0027ve got a huge lounger. And then we\u0027ve got two more small loungers. And then we have our own private plunge pool and shower right there. And this plunge pool is really cool how it\u0027s shaped. It continues the curvature of the room, but it\u0027s just beautiful. And you can swim up. It\u0027s like an infinity edge looking out into the beautiful ocean. And this is one of the premier villas because it\u0027s called Sunset. Only the ones on this side are going to be called the Sunset. And those are the ones that I personally recommend because in the evening you can be sitting here looking out. Now, it\u0027s a little bit windy tonight, but it\u0027s normally not like this and it gets really hot in the summer. So, having a villa like this, you\u0027re going to stay cool and just really beautiful. So, this is amazing. Additionally, on this side, we have some stairs where you can actually walk right down and you can jump in the water yourself and actually go swimming out here in the Red Sea. So, that\u0027s amazing. We can actually swim around our villa. I\u0027m probably not going to swim right now. The water\u0027s a little bit choppy, but that\u0027s really cool. We also have complete privacy. I cannot see any other villas from here. So, you\u0027re really locked in here. Just really cool design. These lights are coming on in the evening, which are really cool. Next up, we\u0027re going to take a look at the bedrooms. This is a two-bedroom villa. So, we have one bedroom with the two beds and then another bedroom with a king bed. Let\u0027s take a look. Now, as we head back through, we have the control panel here. Those doors do have to be closed for the air conditioning to work, but it does have good air conditioning, which is nice. We have a half bath here with toilet and sink. So, this is just a just a kind of a mini one. So, that\u0027s nice feature. Now, let\u0027s head on up. Watch this step here. Great. And I want to show you the first bedroom. So, here we are. We have basically two double beds here. really high ceilings and look at the view. We\u0027re looking out at the deck, the water. I just love this. Beautiful. We have a chair here in the corner. We have the lighting around the bed. Now, compared to Njuma, I will be honest, I\u0027m a little disappointed with the room design here. This is a lot of flat walls going on as well as the ceiling is just very flat. Numa at least had really cool wood in the ceiling and different designs, and they definitely could have done something better here, especially with this space and maybe putting wood paneling in the ceiling. Now, their dune villas have wood paneling in the ceiling, so I think they look a lot better in my opinion. But this one, definitely the overwater villas are more special because we can see the water. So, don\u0027t want to complain too much, but it\u0027s still very nice design. All right, we have another bathroom here that\u0027s just for this room with a whole closet space. Plenty of spaces to store your belongings, tote bag, everything you could need. And then here we have nice soaking tub with a view. So, that\u0027s really cool. However, there are the other villas like right there looking. So, you probably would want to close the shears and that\u0027s very easy to do with just a press of a button. You can also close the main blinds if you want to as well. I love that they have automatic blinds everywhere. We have a beautiful rainfall shower with the soaps and a bench. Really cool lighting. Now, this I love the walls because they go all the way up to the ceiling with that beautiful tiling. We don\u0027t have the experience side jets though like the other like the Numa. Here we have the toilet area private. Love the design as well. So that\u0027s nice. Now these these doors here definitely feel a little bit more on the cheap side. They\u0027re more like I don\u0027t know somewhat plasticky they look like. So I feel like they could have done a little bit nicer door there. Now let\u0027s head around to the master bedroom. Master bedroom is amazing. Offers incredible views. Cool. So let\u0027s head back around. Even along the hallway, I like how it\u0027s completely curved. This whole villa is like in a circle. So, it\u0027s really cool how this kind of curves around. But still, the walls, they definitely I feel like could have done something a little bit more with them or had like wood paneling or maybe some other cool lights in the hallway. Step there. Great. So, real quick, the master bathroom. I have to show you this first because this is special and Numa doesn\u0027t really have anything like this. But this tub is probably the it\u0027s the biggest tub I\u0027ve ever had at any hotel. I\u0027d say it\u0027s very big and this view is incredible. Now, there are a couple villas here, so you can always close the shears if you need extra privacy, but this bathroom is really beautiful. And this is special because it\u0027s not a flat wall. This is completely textured wall here. Just really nice design. I love the mirrors. I love this tiling on the sinks. And we\u0027ve have two sinks in this room. We have the Ren bath products and then we have both a toilet and shower. This is definitely a larger shower, rainfall shower as well. Love the design. Very beautiful tiling and of course the view. You just cannot beat it. Beautiful. You even have a seating chair in here. So, you just have a lot of space. It\u0027s a very large bathroom. Love the lighting. Even this is just amazing. I feel like they could have done this like above the beds. Like even something like this just adds so much to the room. Separate toilet over here with bedet. That\u0027s a very large space there. And this one has a door to close as well. We have a closet in here with robes and slippers. Robes are brand standard. The fert robes. Very soft. I definitely approve. And then the slippers. I\u0027m so glad that they have these. And it looks like yes, they are the fert slippers. And they\u0027re very plush and thick. Extra thick. Wow. This is about as thick as they get. Look at that. and uh little grips on the bottom. Very nice slippers. All right, master bedroom. Let\u0027s take a look. Welcome to the master bedroom. This is beautiful. We have the complete floor to ceiling windows all the way around goes to the corner. So much viewing area of the ocean while you\u0027re in bed. Just really beautiful. A little kind of circle couch there in the corner. They decorated the bed for us. We have a little work desk over there with a view. And then the bed design in my opinion is a little bit more basic. This headboard feel like they could have done something better with it. This is better than a flat wall up top, but I just feel like it\u0027s still missing something. As well as like the work desk area. It\u0027s just a very generic desk here. Nothing special. Nothing special about the chair. And then just this whole wall is just so unattractive. I mean, not a single piece of art, no design. It\u0027s just completely flat and bare. So, it\u0027s definitely lacking when it comes to the design of this place compared especially to Njuma where no detail was left out anywhere. Now, it looks like we can even open these a little bit here. Oh, yeah. I\u0027m glad it doesn\u0027t open all the way or people might jump out, but it opens just a little bit to get some fresh air in. You can listen to the water. So, that\u0027s really cool to have that floor to ceiling door like that. We also have the automatic shades. Next to the bed, we have a little looks like alarm clock with a wireless charger and of course all the controls to either close the shades, open the shades, dim the lights, make them more bright. So very more simplistic design than a Juma, but it\u0027s more unique in that it has, I think, a better view from the water villas here because it\u0027s truly floor to ceiling glass and it also has a really cool bathtub view. So overall, I\u0027m so glad we got to stay at both properties, but the St. Regis, of course, has a lot of other things to offer. The restaurants, you have the butler service, so we do have a butler here to help us and anything that we need, as well as they\u0027ll press two complimentary garments per person per day, complimentary. Okay. So, if you need your clothes ironed or things like that, they\u0027ll be happy to do that for you. Right. So, the living area is just really nice. The lamp is a unique design. It\u0027s like some little like shells or sea items on here. So, that kind of ties the theme of the ocean into the room. Complimentary waters, which is great. I like this kind of cart. That\u0027s actually kind of cool. Then we have another kitchen here. I don\u0027t I don\u0027t understand why they need kitchens, but we have a sink. This is mini bar items for purchase. We have a toaster which I don\u0027t know why you need a toaster. Now this one does have a microwave. So just totally different because the Numa kitchen had a stove top. It had a fridge and freezer and it had a whole dishwasher and it did not have a microwave and it did not have a toaster. So it\u0027s just really interesting how this one does have just different items in here and then a little sink. But yeah, I don\u0027t see any fridge. Maybe it\u0027s on this side. Oh yeah, here it is. Here\u0027s the fridge. And so we just have a fridge, no freezer. These drinks are all for purchase. Espresso machine is very nice wrapped in leather kettle. And this is all complimentary, the teas, and then the assortment of coffees. So those are complimentary while everything else here is for purchase. Let\u0027s take a look at the rest of this resort. Welcome to the stunning Saint Regis Red Sea Resort. an ultra luxury private island escape that marks a major milestone not only for Saudi Arabia but for the global luxury in travel. This isn\u0027t just another five-star property. It\u0027s part of the Red Sea, Saudi Arabia\u0027s ambitious luxury tourism project designed to refine sustainable travel on a global scale. The resort officially opened its doors in early 2024 and holds the distinction of being the first private island resort in the Red Sea, setting the stage for this entire destination\u0027s future. Located on Yumah Island within the serene Al Wahoo Lagoon, the setting here is nothing short of extraordinary. The island is surrounded by over 90 untouched islands, coral reefs that have flourished for more than 5,000 years, and the fourth largest barrier reef system in the world. Now, the moment you arrive here, it becomes clear this is unlike anywhere else. Guests can access the resort by chartered speedboat or sea plane, even a helicopter, which I will show you our full helicopter experience towards the end of this voice over. So, if you want to fast forward and watch that, definitely do not miss it. Now, our arrival experience was a little different because we were already staying at Najuma, the Ritz Carlton, which is the island right next door. And if you\u0027re staying at either resort, you actually get a free shuttle boat ride back and forth to the properties, whether you\u0027re checking into one and out on the other, or you just want to use the spa facilities as well, like we did. They\u0027ll give you a free speedboat ride over. Now, in the very beginning when this hotel opened, I wasn\u0027t sure, should I stay at the St. Reges or the Ritz Carlton? But then I watched a video where someone was able to do both and I was like, \"Oh my goodness, that is awesome that you can just take a boat and get to experience both properties.\" So that is why I was able to experience both Njuma, the Ritz Carlton and the St. Regis on this trip. Now the boat ride was very seamless. We said goodbye to everyone at the Ritz Carlton and then the boat took us right on over here to the St. Regis where a team of people were waiting to greet us and welcome us to the island. It was an incredible arrival experience. We got out, they basically walked us up, introduced us to our butler, and then we were escorted by golf cart all the way to the room. When you first arrived to either resort, both are extremely stunning. You\u0027re surrounded by the crystal blue water. You\u0027re basically on the boat, and then this is where you arrive if you take a boat. Now, you also can take other modes of transportation, but typically when you first arrive to this area, you will fly into the Red Sea International Airport. And then from there, the cheapest option is basically going to be a car transfer to uh a turtle the turtle bay hotel and then they will take you by speedboat to either the St. Regis, the Ritz Carlton or the other luxury resorts in the area and that is how we first got to Najuma the Ritz Carlton. Now when we departed the property here at the St. Regis, we did get to have the experience of taking a helicopter which flies into completely different part of the island. So, it\u0027s a different experience, but you definitely will not want to miss that. Now, on our golf cart ride to the villa, we passed by here, which is the beach club. That is one of their restaurants. Next up here, this is Nesma. This is actually the breakfast restaurant. And if you fast forward, I\u0027ll be able to show you our full breakfast experience. We were at this property for two nights, so we got two nice breakfasts. We just passed by the kids play area. To the left there is the beach. The beach is very extensive here. Now, back there, I believe, was the Japanese restaurant, or one of them is the Japanese restaurant, but unfortunately, it was closed during our stay due to it being in March, which is during Ramadan. Here are the tennis courts to the left. Those are complimentary activities that you can do. You can rent out the paddle boards or tennis equipment included with your stay. To the right here, you\u0027re going to notice all the different beach dune villas. They have a total of about 90 villas total on the whole property, both on land and over the water. They\u0027re a very different design than Njuma. They\u0027re a little bit lower profile and kind of blend more into the sand. Now, here we are around going over the bridge to the one wing of the overwater villas. The property has two separate wings of these overwater villas. This is one of them. The other one is kind of far in the distance on the other side of the island. Now, the ones on the left here are the sunset villas, so they do have a nice view of the sunset. Our bags promptly arrived to our room. Our butler was very kind, able to show us our room and all the different amenities. But right when you walk in, it really is special. I definitely recommend an overwater villa here at the St. Regis. It definitely, I believe, is a lot more special than their dune villas, which I also had the privilege to tour, which I will show you in just a few minutes. But overall, I loved the design of the room itself, just how you had the floor to ceiling windows. Now, the interior decor definitely could use um some help. I wish that they just kept the same decor as the dune villas in these overwater villas and that would make it almost perfect. But the big point about these versus the Njuma outdoor terraces on these overwater villas are a lot bigger. You have a lot more space. Uh they also had the nice lounge chairs with the padding, a nice welcome amenity, automatic blinds. So pretty much everything I look for and it was extremely spacious. And yes, you can request a nightly upgrade award to get this room approved based on availability, which uh is really nice if you\u0027re coming with your family or just need a little bit more space. We also decided to try room service one night. It was promptly delivered. We tried soup and burgers. Everything was actually very tasty. It was hot. Definitely approve. I recommend definitely doing at least one in room dining meal here during your stay just because you want to enjoy your room and the beauty it offers. In the evening, it also comes to life as well. There\u0027s special deck lights. The pool is also perfectly lit. It\u0027s just a really special moment just right out here on your own little patio. You also are able to jump in the water and go for a little swim, although I feel like it can be a little intimidating just because it\u0027s the open ocean, but it\u0027s definitely very refreshing. They also did a very nice turndown service laying out slippers. They do very cool towel art. So, the housekeeping team was phenomenal. Next up, we took the golf cart to have dinner. And on the way, we decided to stop by to take a look at what one of the dune villas looks like. Uh, just to kind of get an idea because at Najuma, we did opt for the beach villa just because we would have our own private beach. So, I just really wanted to see what they looked like here. The villa we got to tour here was number 61, which is a twobedroom villa like the one we had over the water. Right when you walk in, you have a very nice living area here. I love the design of the floor. I loved the decor. The they had a little half bath there. They also still had the floor to ceiling windows which was just really beautiful touch. Now look at the design of this room. How beautiful the wood ceiling is. The paneling also behind the bed you have the little like green um material as well as around the floor. So the design of this room even behind the bed you have all those the wood paneling here in the master bedroom. It\u0027s just so much more thoughtful and beautiful compared to the overwater villas. I wish they would have designed the overwater villas with this same theme, the same interior design. I think they went extremely cheap when it came to the overwater villas. Even the bathroom here is very nice. You have the luminated mirrors, very nice finishes, just uh really beautiful. You do have a bathroom in each area. Again, the master bedroom is just really stunning. I just love that design. And look, again, the wood on the ceiling. The whole ceiling is panled with that wood. I wish they would have done that in the overwater villas. The bathroom here in the master bedroom is also really beautiful. You do have a bathtub with a view, two sinks, and then you have the separate toilet and shower areas, but extremely spacious. And then you also have a beautiful deck you can walk right outside on and head outside. You have your own plunge pool as well as lounge chairs. And you also have really nice landscaping. They did a really good job planting different trees, but very huge deck. Definitely very unique and different compared to Njuma\u0027s beach villas, but still really unique design. You do have porch lighting and then you also have an outdoor shower there to the right kind of hidden underneath the deck. And then you can take the little walkway down and actually walk right onto the beach uh which is a great feature. So the overwater villas are special because you can jump in the ocean, but these beach villas are very nice because you can actually have your own beach and then just walk right up back into your villa. Now, I will be honest. Overall, I do like the design of the beach villas and outside layout a lot better at Njuma. It just seems a little bit more put together and sophisticated. I like the landscaping better versus here. It just seems a little bit more like um not as maintained, the wood is starting to get a little bit faded and it\u0027s just not as put together, I feel. For dinner, we decided to go to their fine dining restaurant over the water. This restaurant is called Telina and it\u0027s floating above the reef. It\u0027s kind of towards the other side of the island away from where our villa was. That colorful mural on the wall actually represents all of the ecosystem and life of the coral reefs around the area. All the bright colors it represents. Now, in the evenings, sometimes the sun, it can be pretty glary when it comes in the window there, so be mindful of that. They also have inside and outside seating, but in the summer it can get extremely hot. So, I definitely do not recommend eating outside. Now, we were basically we felt like the only guests on the island the whole time we were here. where we were the only ones. Here\u0027s a peek at the menu and the different options they have. We tried some appetizers, some main dishes. I\u0027ll go over my feedback in a moment. They start you off with some really yummy bread with some different flavored butters that was really great. I just wish the portion was a little bit more, but they were really spectacular. Now, overall service here compared to Numa was extremely awkward. Um, there wasn\u0027t the best English spoken and then the whole time it was just we weren\u0027t I don\u0027t think checked in on enough. The food was decent, but honestly it wasn\u0027t our favorite. Like the flavors just were not that incredible. It just seemed more generic. They did have, you know, a special appetizer thing they brought as well as a thing at the end, but all of us agreed it was an extremely awkward dinner experience. Um the resort manager later talked to us about it and made it right, but definitely they can improve versus the all the dining experiences we had at the Ritz Carlton across the way which were all just flawless. Next up we have Nesma which is open from about 7:00 a.m. to 3. It\u0027s like breakfast and lunch restaurant. The bright interiors perfectly blend into the outside environment. They have inside and outside seating. Now for elite members, you do get two complimentary breakfasts. It includes everything on that little menu as well as an actual full-on buffet. So, the difference between the Ritz Carlton and here is this one actually does have a full buffet set up. Again, we felt like the only guests on the island. We were literally the only ones here pretty much at breakfast. There was a group that showed up later, but it was very rare we saw anyone else here. Here we have the buffet options. It felt like again like our own private experience. Tons of different yogurts and pastries. They had juices as well. Service was very nice, very accommodating. They also make um sometimes some special pita bread. And then here\u0027s some of the hot dishes. And then of course I ordered sometimes like a eggs benedict or an omelette. They\u0027ll make all those different items for you. The interior though is very thoughtfully designed. It\u0027s very tasteful. I love that the ceiling had like the tarps. They have the different cool lighting. It definitely feels very beachy, tropical, exactly like what you would expect. It just it\u0027s definitely like a eerie feeling when there\u0027s like no hardly other guests there. Um, but it was a great experience. Here they are making the pita bread. Here\u0027s some of the yummy egg dishes that I ordered. They also can make unlimited like cappuccinos or lattes, which is definitely my highlight. Our last day, they actually gave us a little gift. They gave me a whole little box full of some dates. And then they also gave me a little souvenir from the local area. Uh, that is very unique touch. That was very kind of them. Now, right in front of the kind of main sitting area here at the restaurant, you have some of the resorts pools. So, outside of every room/villa having your own little private pool, you also have the public available pools which are also very nicely designed. Uh you have also beach views. The chairs here, the cushions were medium thickness, although the wood on the beach chairs I noticed was also looking very faded. Definitely not up to like the Njuma pool chairs. You can kind of see how faded the chairs are. So, they definitely need to restain those just to kind of update it a little bit better and make it feel a little bit more luxurious. I like that they did have the shade umbrellas for a lot of the chairs just because it can get so hot during the day. But again, there was not very many people here utilizing the pools. Honestly, I never went in any of these pools. I just use the one in my villa. Like, they\u0027re nice, but I wish that they could be like more infinity edge, like maybe up higher, kind of looking out over the ocean. They\u0027re nice, but just, you know, a regular pool like everything else. You also do have nice pool attendants that can help you set up your chair, put your towel out, and then you can walk right from the pool to the beach or back. It\u0027s kind of all together. The beach is very expansive. You not only have the little cabanas with the shade inside, you also have a lot of the chairs around. You can definitely see they\u0027re set up to handle a lot of guests if the hotel is occupied, but we basically had the whole place to oursel. Now, they also provide bikes. So, this is me bike biking around the property on our last night. Here we are, our first stop. This is where you can actually rent equipment such as paddle boarding, going out kaying. Now, these items are extra charge and you can just speak with the resort about renting those. I believe it\u0027s a third party company. Now, they do have volleyball court nets here. They also do have the tennis courts, which I showed earlier. I might show those later as well. Now, when you first arrive to the resort, they not only can check you in at your villa, they also, this one does have like a reception desk. So, this is like what they would consider their lobby, which is right inside here. Inside their lobby, it\u0027s very nicely designed. It\u0027s very spacious. It\u0027s just kind of a place to sit and relax. I\u0027m not sure if they definitely needed this space. Um, it just seems maybe it could be like wasted space because, um, a lot of times you just check it in your villa. But I guess it\u0027s a nice place if you just want to come relax, look around. They also have a gift shop in here. And then they do have the areas where you can sit down and you can actually speak to reception about any questions you might have regarding your bill or your stay. From there, we\u0027re going to continue down. The property is very beautiful in the evening with the sunset lighting. I basically just kind of rode my bike right here by the beach. You could take a look. So many options. Cabanas, chairs, you can go in the water, just kind of relax. I\u0027m not the type of person that just likes to sit out at the beach all day. I like to be active moving around and I honestly just loved our villa. So, I\u0027d rather just relax in our villa, go in our own little pool, and then I did experience the beach more so at Najumo when we did have that beach villa. They have places for you to shower. And now here\u0027s just coming back over this never gets old. The beautiful wooden walkway back all the way to our overwater sunset coral villa. These truly are the best ones on the property. Just stunning design right over the water. Really beautiful. Now, in the evening, the resort really comes to life as well. Here\u0027s the beautiful lighting in the evening. So, if you\u0027re going back to your villa by golf cart or whatnot, it just really beautifully lit. How every panel is lit up along the way all the way to your villa. I just really like the design. Our pool was perfectly lit at night in the evening. It truly is like an outof movie experience just looking out into the ocean at night, but also you can look up and see the stars. There\u0027s so many beautiful stars in the sky. Now, next up, I kind of want to show you the other parts of the property. Next, we\u0027re going to kind of look at the spa area. We did get a tour of the spa because we also did get to look at the spa at Najuma. Now, the spa area is very nice here. You have incredibly wonderful service. Everyone is extremely friendly. You have the lounge area. You also have locker rooms and then you also have kind of the reception area. But I just loved the interior design work. It was very nice. Here is the gentleman\u0027s side of the locker room. You have places to change. It\u0027s very open. plenty of space. And what\u0027s nice is this is available to all guests. You just can reserve uh time and then you can relax in the relaxation areas, change, and then they also do have like a sauna and steam room available to guests, relaxation chairs. So, you do have a lot of different options here. So, when you\u0027re staying at this resort, you can enjoy your villa, the beach, the pools, and then you can come definitely to the spa and experience all of these amazing amenities. This is the best part of the spa. They have a little plunge pool. And then this is also where they have the sauna and steam room. This is just the men\u0027s area, but here\u0027s the sauna. Very nice design. I love how the wood goes all the way from the floor to the ceiling. And they also have the steam steam room. They have the ice. So both this one and Njuma are very great. This one does have a window so you can kind of see outside. The one at Njuma is kind of more just interior view only. I did prefer I like both of them. However, the one that I did use on the trip though was the Njuma one. I just did not have time to use this one. But it\u0027s very nice. It\u0027s a private experience. I believe when you book it that they make sure to limit the amount of guests so it\u0027s not overcrowded. The spa here also does have the areas here where you can have like a hair treatment. They have a lot of different different um plans that you can get for treatments both at the St. Regis and Ajuma and both can be a little bit different. So you can take the boat ride over if you want to go to the other property to get a treatment done. Here\u0027s what one of the treatment rooms looks like. This is the couple\u0027s treatment room. You\u0027ve got the two beds. I love that you have a nice view looking outside. You have the loungers there with some waters. Then you have this really cool bathtub. This is one of their signature special features of their spa that is very unique design compared to every other treatment room or spa in the world. Here\u0027s another look at some other areas where you can kind of get your nails done. So, they definitely have so many different options and treatments available. They also have little treats out, snacks, sometimes special teas. So, it\u0027s a very premium experience and the service is extremely high quality. So, I definitely recommend if you have the time, you\u0027re definitely going to want to relax here, get a treatment or get a treatment here and then also get one at Numa. Both spas are incredibly beautiful. Now, I do want to actually show you real quick our experience uh taking the speedboat from the uh from the St. Regis back to the Numa. So, we actually did do the spa at Numa. We took the speedboat over. Najuma Spa has an outside pool area and then here\u0027s the inside pool area. I got my own robe, a little note, and then inside they do have the sauna, steam room, pool, ice. In my opinion, it just feels a little bit more expensive and premium than the one at the St. Regis. The sauna is also just a little bit bigger. So, I did honestly enjoy the one at Ajuma better. Now, here we are continuing our tour of the property. That\u0027s the bike. They do have bikes in front of your villa when you get there, so you can bike all the way around. Now, I just showed you the spa. So, next up, we\u0027re going to take a look here at the fitness center. It\u0027s a very beautiful fitness center because you do have the very nice windows that have amazing views looking out. So, when you\u0027re running on the treadmill or the elliptical machines, I love the view. It\u0027s really spectacular. I love the wood paneling in the ceiling. I love the lighting. You had a ton of free weights. You also had other workout equipment. I love the wood flooring. It just felt extremely sophisticated, premium, and it was very spacious. They also even have like personal fitness coaches that you can rent that can help you with your performance. They had little energy bars out, water, lemon water. They also had very premium earphones, complimentary, which is awesome. Right outside from the fitness center there, you have a kind of plunge pool area so you can just take a plunge after before your workout just to kind of reset, relax. So, this is just more public area, swimming pools on property that are still all included with your stay. This is more of like a vitality pool here with the bubble chairs. Njuma does not have one yet, but they are in the process of building their own vitality pool, which is always a great feature. Here are the tennis courts. We did do one session late in the evening. You can basically reserve them at any time. They\u0027re very spacious and they provide you all the equipment that you need. Here\u0027s the kids club. The kids club is awesome because if you\u0027re a family here, your kids have something to do. It\u0027s extremely nice. They have all kinds of toys and games and not only an inside play area, but also a whole outside like jungle gym play area here that will keep the kids occupied for hours on end just having one of the best times of their life. But again, my favorite feature is definitely just biking around the island, especially over these wooden walkways over the water. There\u0027s just nothing like it. Now, the exit experience here was incredible. Now, the water was extremely rough and choppy the last morning um to head to the airport. So, it was somewhat I believe unsafe for a boat ride. So, the hotel actually provided us a helicopter transport to take us all the way to the Red Sea International Airport straight from the resort. So, they basically take you by golf cart to the private area on the island where the helicopter comes. We\u0027re then able to board the helicopter. It actually could hold 14 people, so it\u0027s a fairly large helicopter. And um if you\u0027re interested in doing this, it is also something you can pay extra money for and then you can get uh arrival and departure service. The views were phenomenal, especially at the window seat. It\u0027s just a amazing experience lifting off from one island and then flying all the way back to the Red Sea. You get to see the beautiful development on the way back. You can also spot some of the other upcoming resorts that they\u0027re building. But it\u0027s just also fascinating to think how they built this resort. How all of the huge ships had to come in to bring all the materials to build all these villas and just bring in all the food. It\u0027s really truly spectacular to see the resort from the air at a completely different level. And also just looking at the beautiful ocean water. Saudi Arabia has big plans for this area. They\u0027re building numerous brand new luxury resorts right now in almost every luxury brand that you can think of. And they want it to be very easy for people to transit here. So, they\u0027re actually building a brand new terminal at the Red Sea airport right now to expand service flights, allow more people to come in. Um, it\u0027s a very cool project, but it\u0027s just really cool just being out here in Saudi Arabia. I never thought I\u0027d ever make it, but in the distance there, you can see the brand new terminal that they\u0027re working on building. It\u0027s going to be an amazing destination, and they want to have a lot of non-stop flights to a lot of different destinations all around the world. Now, if you don\u0027t take a direct flight from the resort like this all the way to the Red Sea airport, it does require a speedboat which then takes you to land and then from there you do get a vehicle, usually a brand new beautiful Mercedes to then drive you back to the airport. So, those are the different options. You can also opt for a better speedboat like a yacht, but the resort definitely gives you all that information. Now, the Red Sea airport, the current terminal is extremely nice. It\u0027s modern, beautiful. This is like baggage claim when you first arrive. So, even coming back by helicopter, you have to go through baggage claim. Although, the helicopter pilot just gives you your bags right when you get off. Now, when you first get to the resort here, you do walk through this area and then that\u0027s just a quick look at that Mercedes that we did get to take when we first went to Njuma. So, definitely watch the Njuma video and you can watch that full experience of the super luxury Mercedes ride. Now, entering the main terminal itself to exit the country. Very nice, very helpful staff. They have a little coffee shop, but this is the most premium terminal I\u0027ve ever seen. Every design is perfect. You have the beautiful paneling and then you get a bus that takes you right out to the airplane. And then this was us heading back to Riad. All right, now for the review of the St. Regis Red Sea. I\u0027m going to go and start with the rooms. The rooms are insane, especially these overwater villas. Like this is one of the most insane views ever. Same thing with the beach villas. But the rooms I\u0027m going to give a 4.5 out of five. And the reason for that is even though this resort is only about a year old, they\u0027re becoming worn actually pretty quick. And I feel like it\u0027s a big part due to all the wood. I think it needs to be restained. It\u0027s just starting to look a little bit faded. As well as the room design here is not as nice as Njuma. Like even in our villa here, there\u0027s so many just flat walls. It\u0027s like they completely skipped like a half interior decorating. Like the ceilings, the walls, there\u0027s like nothing there. It\u0027s just furniture just pushed up against the the walls of the room. Um, and I noticed that a little bit too in like even the two-bedroom beach villa we looked at. So that one, the master bedroom is a lot better because there\u0027s a design behind the headboard. But here, even the designs behind the headboards of the bed, they\u0027re just extremely basic. So I feel like they put a lot of money into like building this really cool spiral design. When it came to the interior, they went very cheap here. Compared to Njuma, it\u0027s the complete opposite. You have all the wood in the ceiling. It\u0027s just so much better for the room design. For that reason, I just couldn\u0027t give it the full full score because it\u0027s not the most super luxury resort that I\u0027ve seen. Next up is going to be Inspiration. Inspiration overall, I\u0027m going to give a five out of five. This is just incredible. Like, it\u0027s still mind-blowing when you\u0027re going over the ramp and the dock to get to your villa over the water or the beach villas. It\u0027s still a very beautiful resort and it\u0027s just so special being out here. Next up is going to be service. Overall, I\u0027m going to give service a five out of five. It was excellent service. I will be honest, overall Numa was a little bit better in just every single area here. It started off nice, just like any other nice St. Regis, but um dinner was a little bit on the awkward side, just when it came to service and things like that. But their service recovery here is really good. They really if something isn\u0027t right or uncomfortable, they\u0027ll make it right or they\u0027ll talk to you. And they have went above and beyond to make things right and just make us feel special. And um upper management here is just tremendous. So, we couldn\u0027t leave happier. And we\u0027re actually really happy with the service overall. Finally is going to be value. Would I return that? I\u0027m going to give a five out of five. I actually if I come back, I would want to not only stay in Numa, probably more nights, but I still would like to stay here at least a night just because it\u0027s uh these overwater villas have a much bigger deck than the ones at Numa. So, it just has more space and shade and it\u0027s just kind of a really cool design. And each resort offers, you know, unique aspects that the other one doesn\u0027t. So, it is cool at least being here a little bit. But overall, Najuma by far is the winner and I would like to spend more nights there next time. But I don\u0027t want to rule this one out because it\u0027s still just incredibly unique and I would love to come back here and we have made friends with a lot of the staff here as well. So, we\u0027d love to see them again. But overall, incredible hotel. Definitely add this one to your list. If you\u0027re looking to stay here, it can be pretty expensive. Rooms, basic rooms starting at about $2,000 per night or so. I highly recommend though using your Marriott Bonvoy points. It\u0027s only about 160,000 points per night, give or take a little bit to stay here, which is more than a penny a point, which is tremendous value. And then we used a nightly upgrade a wart to get this villa. So this one actually is normally $4,000 per night. So we\u0027re getting like over two pennies a point for the redemption, which is just an incredible deal. The hotel right now for Ramadan is very slow. There\u0027s only like they said four or five villas occupied, I think. Um because the month of March, a lot of people faster stay home with their families. So March is a great time to come visit where you\u0027re going to have pretty much the whole island to yourself. So in a way it was uh just a lot more peaceful than if there are a lot of guests here. But beautiful resort. Definitely consider it. I can\u0027t wait to see you in the next review."}

left outside and I found out this hotel has maybe five different malls connected to it and some of these malls are 12 floors uh so it\u0027s huge you don\u0027t even have to go outside of the hotel everything is connected this hotel has the perfect location perfect size the only thing I didn\u0027t like about this is the view there\u0027s no way to upgrade the view this is what you get"}
{"video_id":"XSFjeJZueR4","lang":"en","full_text":"hello I\u0027m your guardian angel and I\u0027m going to help you while you are in Korea right so I\u0027ll give you very very useful information on accommodation today so follow my guide so okay now that you have decided to come to Soul so you have to decide a lot of things before you come here right so what is the first thing that you need to consider mhm yes the accommodation you have to choose a place to stay while in Soul but you have looked at the map of soul and oh my God it\u0027s such a big city I don\u0027t know where to stay yes it\u0027s confusing so that\u0027s why I\u0027m here as your guide and I\u0027m going to give you three areas of my pick for you to stay in Korea so those areas are not on Google or those areas are not usually in travel books because you have looked at Google and what does it say usually H Tuesday right and also the area near the qu Mall oh no no no I don\u0027t recommend those areas because as a local I find those areas very expensive and I know better places for you to stay I have better options for you my three areas are better in terms of location and accessibility by public transportation also nearby attractions as well so please watch my video and you\u0027ll find three wonderful F areas to stay in [Music] s number one area near Kung do subway station Kung do oh Kung do okay what is it I\u0027m a soul expert I have been to Soul a few times and I\u0027ve never heard of kog yes that could be your reaction kog is more of a hidden gam and local area and not touristy so many tourists don\u0027t go there but I recommend kog because it\u0027s located centrally so you can get to any part of the city so easily and also it has a lot of attractions near the area so for one I\u0027m going to talk about the location first as I said it\u0027s centrally located and lots of Subway Lines meet there subway line number five and line six and Kong chungang and one more RX do you know what RX is RX is something that you\u0027re going to take from the intern and international airport so if you take the RX from the intern International Airport which is airport railroad Express trade you can go to k do directly and it takes about 45 minutes oh that\u0027s so convenient right so that\u0027s why I\u0027m am suggesting you stay in kog while in Sal because it\u0027s centrally located and you can use lots of subways also there are lots of buses and taxes outside of the subway station and you can get to any part of the city for example you are going to go to Kung Palace right yes you can go there and also Quang Moon area and if you want to go to H or Y where young people gather together for fun yes you can take the suby line number six and also subway line number six goes to E1 as well so it\u0027s so good and public accessibility is wonderful in kok area but Kung area is more than a transportation Hub it has its very unique attractions as well so near the kok station you have a lot of traditional markets and one of the traditional markets I suggest is oh this is the wonderful I love this area this is called ping Ali of kunga ping literally is Korean fried pancake it\u0027s very thin and very big and everybody loves it and they have dozens of different tastes and even vegetarians they can choose lots of options in the Bing allei so you go there and have fun and get delicious food there and you are going to love the kok area Okay number two it\u0027s y y oh y y I have heard of it oh isn\u0027t it a business district yes it is a business district and it\u0027s also a media center and a center for Politics as well so that means a lot of people during the daytime and you might say oh at night it\u0027s going to be dangerous because it\u0027s going to be empty no Yoo is changing and there are lots of restaurants and shopping malls in yo so even during the nighttime it\u0027s very crowded and safe as well I mean not that crowded but you can see people on the streets so you can go to yido and have fun during the daytime and night too and if you look at the map of so yido is literally located in the middle of so close to the middle so you can go to the northern part of the city kanguk and southern part of the city K also West and East oh East and West you can get to any part of the city easily so you can also use Subways there are be line five and line nine and a lot of bus stops also so location and public accessibility of course very wonderful in Yoo area and also if you want to stay in central area but if you want to be closer to Nature yo is the perfect place because you know Han River Han river is right there you can walk to the Han River and the Han river parks and you can enjoy the nature and the stunning view of the city and the river and also you can have picnics like locals and you can also get to take a boat a cruise or yacht there and enjoy the view of the city so yo has a lot to offer right and attention please if you are into shopping do you love shopping do you love shopping hello yes we love shopping if you are into shopping yo is the perfect place we have two two good places for you one is the hund soul the most luxurious department store in Soul right now and the second one the other one is IFC Mall this is another big shopping more in yo so you should go to both of them because the Hondas for example oh do you know the hundas is one of the most visited um department stores among foreigners one out of 10 visitors yes Is Foreigner so you should go to the hundes hall and IFC Mo and you\u0027re going to love it and yo as I said it\u0027s a center for Politics as well so there is a National Assembly build building and we have very tall building in yo too 63 building which was the tallest building in Korea yes but it\u0027s not anymore but they have a amazing uh they have an amazing observation deck so from the 63 story or 62nd anyway up there you can see the amazing view of the whole city and if you happen to be in yo in March you\u0027re so lucky yes I love cherry blossom and you would love cherry blossom too yo has the festival called Cherry Blossom Festival the festival is going to kick off the cherry blossom season in so and you are going to enjoy a lot of beautiful trees turning into pink and do you know how many of the trees we have in yido we have more than 1,700 trees in yido and you\u0027re going to be so lucky to be here in March but one problem is that a lot of people thousands of people would be there so it might be so crowded and one more yes the hotel prices are going to be so expensive during the festival so remember that before you plan your trip so number three last but not least is kown station if you are interested in Soul you should know kangam yes the fire famous klam inside kangam style yes kangam style yes the famous one yes kangam is is a very rich neighborhood in Korea and has a lot of upscale shops and trendy cafes and restaurants and a lot of clubs yes the country\u0027s best nightclubs are located in kangam area so it\u0027s very popular among young people especially and a lot of people during the daytime and night so you\u0027re going to feel safe all the time and the reason I have picked kangam station is you have lots of options for public transportation K is Subway line number two so you can use the subway you can get to many parts of the city so easily and if you are outside of the subway station you\u0027re are going to see lots of bus stops that go everywhere actually literally everywhere in the city so you can take any bus and you can go to any part of the city easily north south east west or no matter where you go so transportation is wonderful but other than that as I said lots of things to do and also kangam station is a tourist attraction itself why it has underground shopping center there and then we have more than a thousand shops that sell everything oh so I heard that it\u0027s the biggest oh underground Shopping Center in Asia have you heard of that so you have to go there and enjoy shopping and also you are a few stops few service stops away away from Cox Mall yes Cox M is so famous among foreigners and they also have 250 shops there too and also near quo you can go to pansa Temple ponga Temple oh we have such a big standing Buddha and you can see it and then you can enjoy on Korea\u0027s temple in bua in addition s trendy neighborhoods Aku and shin are nearby so from kangam State you can get there easily so you should go there to see how trendy it is in Sal so I have given you information on where to stay in Korea how was it you\u0027ve never I me heard of K station those could be good options and if I had my friends coming over to Korea I would recommend those areas for my friends so I hope you likeed my information and if you have liked my Channel please before you go don\u0027t forget to press the Subscribe button and also the like button

{"video_id":"OwLscnvu-jo","lang":"en","full_text":"in this video we\u0027ll show you the Golden Tulip hotel in Incheon South Korea we covered a room that we stayed at in Hidden gym and shuttle service and we\u0027ll give you our verdict about whether this hotel is worth your money but not just that we\u0027ll also be giving you lots of tips to make the most out of your stay since you\u0027re watching yes and Explorer where we travel smarter not harder we\u0027ve arrived at unseo station which is a metro station connected to the regular airport rail line from here we\u0027re taking a left turn and we make our way to the Golden Tulip Incheon Hotel plus the name suggests this hotel is located in Incheon city right outside of Seoul and very close to the airport there are many hotels in this area as well as a small shopping street with restaurants and a large supermarket so why do we choose to spend our last night here you might wonder well because of money not spending the night in Seoul from a Saturday onto a Sunday especially when there are concerts happening saves you a ton of cash that plus the convenience of already being close to the airport for the next morning\u0027s flight it is a logical decision for us and not to forget the hotel has an airport shuttle that\u0027s included in the room rates foreign was easy to find from the station although finding the entrance wasn\u0027t it\u0027s a very big building and there are multiple entrances but the one you need is not the one with the hotel tour sign but the one that\u0027s right next to the CU Mini Mart [Music] here we entered a hotel and we step into a big Lobby we happen to arrive around one in the afternoon but check-in doesn\u0027t start until 3. you can pay extra if you want to use your room already but we didn\u0027t want to do that so we had a bite to eat and came back two hours later check in went quickly and we made sure to reserve a spot for the complimentary airport shuttle and we even received a coupon for a free Americano at the CU convenience store after that we made our way to the fourth floor where we booked a standard twin room for this we paid 61 Euros per night excluding breakfast and here\u0027s our first impression of the room we are in room 412 at the mass of Golden Tulip in xiam knock in the door and who is there it\u0027s the lovely Lawrence yay we\u0027re coming in we\u0027re welcomed into the room by Lawrence what we\u0027ll do is we\u0027ll take an immediate turn for the left and look inside the bathroom hello right here you can see that they Supply the bathroom with some mini shampoos there is of course your sink a fairly big mirror everything is looking nice and clean we\u0027ve got a Japanese toilets again love it it\u0027s got functions and pictures in case you don\u0027t read Korean so loving that and in case of emergency there\u0027s also a button oh look at that there\u0027s just a translation right there it\u0027s wonderful and I\u0027m right over here we\u0027ve got our shower it\u0027s a rainfall shower it\u0027s fairly big and it all looks pretty good so let\u0027s take another look at this bathroom a full there we go exit the door this is where we came in and this is the Colossal thing with the one door that they\u0027re very fond of recently um we have some closet space right here with a little light fire extinguisher and right over here there is the bathrobes swimming room slippers and a safe and right over here we have a coffee tea you name it and a really big fridge which is nice the fridge also comes with a surprise it\u0027s lots and lots of ice oh well and we got three complimentary bottles of water so that\u0027s always okay right over here you see Lawrence reading this menu hoping to find some clues about how to get more subscribers to our Channel let\u0027s hope he finds them and if you can help please do all right so we\u0027ll go over to the beds we booked a standard twin room and the room also has bigger rooms but we chose standard ones just for one night and it all looks fine there\u0027s a television which we I don\u0027t understand how to turn on yet because it\u0027s complicated and so and then there\u0027s of course space for luggage right here so that\u0027s also good and a last but not least oh no before I forget what\u0027s over here right over here we have an extra station for tables this is very nice so you can charge your phone they really thought this true I really enjoyed that so that\u0027s good for them and then we go back to a view of the room [Music] it\u0027s the streets yay with some mountains in the background or is it just a dirty window Incheon area super close to the Metro highway so that\u0027s great now one last overview of [Music] we enjoyed this room it was only for a one night stay it\u0027s a big room and it really serves its purpose for a short one to two night stay since we had the whole Saturday afternoon we decided to pay a visit to the hotel gym but that was easier said than done we saw signs for a fitness center but they pointed to nowhere where\u0027s the gym during our fitness Room Treasure Hunt we we\u0027ve crossed something very strange it appears that there\u0027s a whole other company within the hotel that also rents out hotel rooms under a different name so it\u0027s basically Hotel within a hotel we had never seen this before and to be fair we found it a little sketchy but who knows it\u0027s probably a perfectly normal situation so here we are still looking for the gym we were about to give up when we realized it might be located in a different building was they have some sort of residential building that we stood for the reception when we just arrived and once in there you need to go to the third floor and there you\u0027ll find the general space in the third floor converted into a gym [Music] and although it was dark and the water dispenser was empty it was still a pretty well equipped and overall support decent hotel gym [Music] thank you the next morning we checked out and like I mentioned before the Hotel offers a free shuttle service to the airport but making a reservation with the front desk beforehand is absolutely necessary we recommend to do this immediately during check-in now you will then receive a coupon to give to the bus driver the next morning and it will just take you straight to the airport shuttle goes every hour on the hour and it takes about 20 minutes to get there did you miss it or if the bus is full there is always the airport line that easily takes you to the airport in 10 minutes except it\u0027s just it\u0027s not free if you do decide to take the shuttle and won\u0027t be using your public transport team Money Card anymore you can refund the remaining balance of the Mini Mart next to the hotel provided it has less than 20 000 Korean won on it and you can actually do this at any of the convenience stores in the area although at times the hotel was a bit confusing we did enjoy our stay overall the room was good the price made it very attractive and it\u0027s very convenient to get to the airport from there so we would definitely recommend this if you have an early flight or if you arrive late some Incheon Airport in our next video we have something exciting we\u0027ll be flying back to Bangkok with air Asia\u0027s budget business class so stay tuned for that and don\u0027t forget that if you want to see more subscribe to us at yes and explore thank you so much for watching bye huh"}
{"video_id":"qRk-hZuEwr4","lang":"en","full_text":"I have lived in Soul for over 20 years and would have no reason to stay in any of these hotels well uh maybe one which I\u0027ll get to later but this is an introduction to the best hotels in Soul that I would stay at there is a reason I would stay at each of these hotels and the reasons are each different so watch till the end to find the suitable stay based on your needs and desires or perhaps budget as well note I am not being paid by any of these hotels this is solely based on my opinion which comes from experience research and just the common sense of being a local if I have money to burn or someone else is paying for my stay I would stay at the signal soul in the LTE World Tower you could definitely argue this to be the nicest hotel in Korea but what\u0027s Undisputed is that you\u0027ll be staying in the tallest building in Korea the luta world Tower which was completed in 2016 boasts 123 floors and you would be sleeping somewhere between the 76th and 101st floors for stunning views of the kangnam district and let\u0027s face it you get to say that you stayed in one of the most iconic buildings in Soul pretty much this would be where most people even in Korea would like to stay for at least one night if they had the opportunity at around $400 per night the cost isn\u0027t really a deal breaker and it\u0027s definitely not the most expensive hotel in Soul but most people probably wouldn\u0027t be able to afford an extended stay here the signal has more going for it than just being tall and expensive too it\u0027s located right above chami station that means you\u0027ll have easy access to Soul Subway and being on the TW line is particularly good even though the actual location in Soul\u0027s Southeast corner is a little bit isolated whether you like to shop or not having LTE World Mall at your doorstep is also really nice as the Hub also includes a lot of good restaurants as well as other entertaining features like their aquarium and the kicker for this hotel is that L world is right across the street Lotte world is the biggest amusement park within the city limit of Soul there are bigger places like everland and soul land which also have zoos as a part of their entertainment Extravaganza but both are part of the greater Soul area so it\u0027s a little more challenging to get to those places L World features both an indoor and outdoor area filled with rides and other fun stuff for kids and bigger kids alike there\u0027s also a skating rink within the complex and a nice Lake surrounding the area the signel soul really has everything that you\u0027d want in a place to stay in Soul good location five-star rating for quality and service amenities and a great neighborhood if I were visiting soul and I could afford it the signel would be at the top of my list especially if I were coming with a family other top hotels I would recommend if you have a good budget and you value things like access to the subway good location and a good neighborhood to explore check out these the LTE hotel in Mong dong it\u0027s connected to the luta department store which has the best duty-free shopping in Korea plus it\u0027s right across the street from yongdong which is a top tourist destination for street food and mid tier shopping it\u0027s at Ido ilga on the two line for Subway accessibility but the great thing here is the access to the neighborhood of yongdong which is basically the most expensive place in Korea for retail real estate so it\u0027s a bustling area if you want to be around the action although some people will call the area a bit of a tourist trap as well the Park Hyatt InterContinental Grand as well as the Intercontinental coex are each top rated hotels located right at Samsung station connected to coek shopping mall once again two-line access for the subway and a bit more centrally located in kangna coex mall is also a Great Mall to be around when the weather is not as nice plus there\u0027s a 7l casino here if you want to gamble during your stay the coex mall also has an iconic library or a bookstore that you can visit as well and there\u0027s also another hotel that\u0027s a part of this complex called the oak wood they offer long-term stays and are known for hosting some of the foreign baseball players who play for the soul-based kbo teams one more Hotel I\u0027m going to name for being a top tier hotel that\u0027s centrally located and connected to a shopping mall is the Marriott hotel at the express bus terminal this hotel features the shin department store at its doorstep and I\u0027d say the advantage to the marot though is that it has three different Subway Lines that converge at this point the three seven and nine lines with the nine line having an Express line that goes straight to Kimo airport in 30 minutes or also connects to the airport line to get you to Inon airport in about an hour also near the Marriott hotel is the Han River Park if you want to enjoy some nature on your stay or check out where they shot Avengers Age of Ultron as well and not only do they have like the expensive shopping of the shinsa department store but they do also have a shopping alley in the underground of the subway station as well so it\u0027s kind of more of a bargain hunter shopping area but it\u0027s about a mile long and there\u0027s a lot to see there as well if you\u0027re a bargain hunter now let\u0027s say you can\u0027t afford to be spending $300 to $500 per night the holiday in express in hung is closer to the $100 range and is right at Exit 4 of hondai station hung is one of the most popular places to stay when visiting soul for a number of reasons first off it\u0027s a University District so things are relatively reasonably priced and there are a lot of fun places like bars nightclubs and coffee shops hongi University is also known as one of Korea\u0027s top art schools so there are a lot of of funky artsy things in the area as well and there are lots of designated areas for busking and street performing where people regularly gather to check out some of the stars of tomorrow perhaps if you can\u0027t find a room at the Holiday Inn there are tons of guest houses and Airbnb rooms for rent in this area that will run you anywhere from $50 to $150 per night depending on what you\u0027re looking for as well as usually its proximity to the subway station or the main strip if you\u0027re looking for a stay under $50 per night it can be a little bit challenging to find a good place at that price point but I\u0027ve known people that have stayed at the milor hotel right at yongdong station exit 5 that were impressed with the value paying less than $50 per night during an extended stay with their regular prices being right around $50 per night and if you\u0027re looking for things as cheap as possible right across the street from the milori up the hill from exit 3 at yongdong station there are a bunch of hostiles and guest houses that can be cheaper but you might find them to be a bit older perhaps even a little bit rund down so again I live in Soul I don\u0027t need to stay at a hotel here but I have been to several of these hotels on occasion when friends or family visit or we do a station and these represent what I would do if I were visiting soul on a budget or with someone else paying my bills the one last thing I\u0027ll say is for a station I\u0027d actually go to a hotel outside of Soul proper right by inan airport now the Hotpot before Was A Place Called Paradise City and it is still a top two or three Resort in Korea but there is a brand new place not too far from Paradise City right behind inchon airport called the mohagen Inspire and it just opened at the end of 20123 and is clearly the new toy of Korean hotels as an allinclusive Resort that features an indoor water park a 150 M long LED ceiling show much like the LG system in the old part of Las Vegas but much more modernized the complex also has a 15,000 seat performance hall for concerts or perhaps giant conventions and this is all on the site of a place that has basically the size of 64 football fields featuring 1275 room so this place is absolutely enormous and there are other additions being made to the resort over the next couple of years so it\u0027s not even at its full self just yet so if you don\u0027t really want to do all the touristy stuff in Korea and especially if you\u0027re traveling with kids both Paradise City and the moan Inspire could be impressive places to relax and have fun especially if you\u0027re going to be in Korea when the weather is warmer from May to September expect prices to be anywhere from 300 to 600 Depending on time of year as well as week nights versus weekends because a lot of Koreans go there for stations as well those are my suggestions for where to stay when traveling to Soul if you have any questions feel free to post them below and I\u0027ll do my best to answer those for you also please do like the video and subscribe to the channel as it really does help me out a lot uh certainly if you want more information on how to best enjoy Korea either while traveling or simply vicariously on your sofa or kitchen uh do subscribe to the channel and I\u0027ll do the best I can to provide you with great content thanks for watching this till the end"}

but we\u0027re doing the two best hotels in my opinion in downtown Denver both of mar the Ritz Carlton here and also the Sheron here\u0027s the Rival entrance of the Ritz Carlton it\u0027s one of the most expensive hotels in the whole city and one of the most luxurious um the rooms look amazing that\u0027s the main reason why I chose it they look very luxurious but I\u0027m really excited to actually review the property and show you let\u0027s go [Music] okay here we are at the Ritz Carlton Denver come on in I can\u0027t wait to show you the room so right when we come in we have this little area here with this nice little rack with all these little amenities from juice to the espresso machine that\u0027s highend complete opposite of what the Sheron Denver had this is an actual high-end coffee machine which is the cream of the crop now right when you walk in as well we have the bathroom over here okay so right when you walk in the first impression of the bathroom is wow very luxurious feeling a lot more luxurious than the Sheran dead were probably one of the most luxurious bathrooms beautiful countertop as well with we have a shower and toilet room and a big tub so you not only have the tub you also have the shower and um even the flooring just every little detail of the bathroom feels very nice it\u0027s not extreme well but it is definitely high and on luxurious now let\u0027s go ahead and take a look at the room part which is going to be over here so walking this way there\u0027s this little hallway there\u0027s a nice big double door closet here plenty of space to store your belongings there\u0027s two luggage rocks in there um as well as um the safe and things like that so the nice thing is here we do have the two luggage rocks we do have a robe however it is extremely thin not plush at all I do not approve and then we do have the brand standard slippers which are really thick these are I prove of they\u0027re very nice but there was just only one pair in our closet now into the main room itself it is very spacious even more spacious than the Sheran room that we were in but we got the two queen beds in the room and I really like this overhang of the lights adds an element of sophistication that um luxury hotels are known for as well as this different layering of the of the headboard here with the wall just uh really nice touches we have a nightstand here with real glasses notepad and then um the room is all carpeting except for the main when we first walk in which is hardwood but everything does feel very clean it feels very luxurious very homey I\u0027m really impressed so far as well in front of the beds you can view the TV here and we have storage areas as well as a fridge in there where you can store your drinks now over here we do have a work desk there\u0027s a lot of business Travelers that stay at this property Monday through Thursday so you have a space here with Outlets you can work this chair is getting a little old a little dated um but they\u0027re actually going to be doing a remodel of this hotel probably comes summer and that\u0027s a sneak peek um they\u0027re not really putting it out there that much but I\u0027m really excited to come back when everything is remodeled so if you come on over here now I want to show you this area cuz we actually have a space here as well to sit down on or maybe put your luggage out you just have some extra uh space over here but the room does feel larger than the Sheran room but it definitely feels more luxurious and nice um we do still have a lot of just bare flat walls in the room which doesn\u0027t really Inspire that high end of luxury but I\u0027m excited to see what the remodel looks like from next year we do have a view as well looking out the Denver uh downtown area which is um a great place to have the City View room overall so far I\u0027m super impressed definitely a luxurious room it\u0027s not extreme wild like a lot of other Ritz carltons I\u0027ve been to around the world but for the Denver area and for the USA it actually is quite up there I really feel comfortable in here and it is nice now I can\u0027t wait to show you the rest of the hotel let\u0027s check it out the Ritz Carlton Denver is centrally located near the 16th Street Mall it\u0027s not one of the coolest looking buildings but it still is a very good location now the hotel does have 202 rooms and Suites now they are beginning to look a little bit dated but they\u0027re still very decent I did enjoy my stay it did feel luxurious but it was getting a little bit tired but the rooms off most of them feature good city views um not in the perfect location in Denver but it was at least close to the 16th Street Mall the hotel does have one restaurant on property called lways it is very spacious but it is extremely dated and really showing its age now they do offer breakfast lunch and dinner we did try breakfast and I will be honest the breakfast was actually very good we really enjoyed it um but otherwise I\u0027m excited to be back when it is remodeled now the hotel does also offer a fitness center that is open all the time to guests it was very modern it doesn\u0027t have any sort of views or city views it\u0027s kind of like downstairs but still nice now the hotel does also have a spa it is an extra charge though of $75 for guests and $100 if you\u0027re not a guests they do have a steam room though that\u0027s included as well as a Whirlpool cool drinks relaxation lounge and showers the hotel also does have nice meeting spaces and really beautiful Lobby bathrooms now in the morning until about 11:00 a.m. this hotel does put off coffee and tea which is a great feature to kind of start the day off right okay now for the review of The Ritz Carlton Denver so let\u0027s go ahead and start with the room the room is going to get a 5 out of five it was clean well it wasn\u0027t like extravagant it was still clean nice especially the bathroom very luxurious next up is going to be inspiration this hotel is going to get a four out of five for me on inspiration it\u0027s of course nothing like a lot of the other Ritz carltons I\u0027ve been to around the world that are just extreme wow it\u0027s still very nice it\u0027s just it is getting a little bit older and dated and that\u0027s actually why they\u0027re going to remodel the property coming this summer so I can\u0027t wait to come back and I\u0027m sure by then it will be a 5 out of five on inspiration but right now it is just a four everything is looking a little tired especially the breakfast and their um their main restaurant there as well as um just the room it\u0027s getting a little bit tired the furniture and everything next up is going to be uh Service uh the service is going to get a 4 and 1 half out of five now let me start the service here compared to other rit carons in the US I\u0027ve been to has been very good front desk staff perfect so friendly so accommodating absolutely amazing the areas for improvement why it\u0027s only a 4 and a/2 is specifically coming in and out of the doors half the time no one was there to open the door and the other half they only opened one door when there was two doors there is BR standard to have those doors open every time so most of the times we did have to open our own door but at a Ritz Carlton you do expect that high level of service which just didn\u0027t happen every time okay the other reason for a little bit lower score on service is um I think it should be important every time you\u0027re walking through the lobby to be greeted or have someone visiting with you which I\u0027ve had at a lot of other properties that I\u0027ve stayed at um they just it wasn\u0027t really anyone unless you go to the front desk to like visit with um I do appreciate the men they delivered to them with our status um so that was a plus so good service it just it could be improved and then finally value how much do I personal personally value the property I\u0027m going to go ahead and give that a four out of five um the reason is because uh while it still is a luxury hotel and probably the best hotel in Denver that I would choose to stay at other than the Four Seasons which just got a full renovation um it still has a lot of improvement from uh the dated rooms restaurant a little bit more of service and then the views are they\u0027re nice but they\u0027re not like incredible um but otherwise I can\u0027t wait to come back when everything is completely remodeled I think it could get a perfect score but otherwise still a great score here for the Ritz Carlton okay now for the pricing so if you\u0027re using your marriet bonvoy points it\u0027s only 50 to 70,000 points a night now the cash rate is going to be between like $500 to $700 a night and some peak times even up to over $11,000 so depending on the price point it actually makes sense to use points cuz if the rate is around $500 and you\u0027re only spending 50,000 points Point you\u0027re getting a penny a point which I consider a very good value um if it\u0027s uh like even if the price is over you know 7800 even $1,000 and it\u0027s maybe 70,000 points you\u0027re still getting that penny a point so I would recommend using points to stay at the Ritz Carlton here as it is a very very good value compared to the cash rate"}

{"video_id":"VSTi8R-lmno","lang":"en","full_text":"The only 5-star hotel in Korea with a Gyeongbokgung homepage. The ultra-luxurious Four Seasons Hotel Seoul, located in the heart of Gwanghwamun, South Korea, is as good as the Yeongseong (spirituality) of the fire. Let\u0027s find out together with the excellent G clothes. [Music] Hello, I\u0027m also a man who leaves. My name is a luxury hotel chain that is famous worldwide for its paradoxical yet comfortable atmosphere. In Korea, it first opened on October 1, 2015, at the intersection of Gwanghwamun Station. It is the only hotel to be named a 5-star hotel by Cobis TV ID, along with Shilla Ute. Looking at the exterior of the building, it looks like an ordinary high-rise building in downtown Seoul, but when you go inside, you can see the unique characteristics of the calm yet luxurious Four Seasons Hotel. The hotel entrance has a mocha-like painting, and even the decoration behind the check-in counter shows the classic yet Korean aspect that the hotel aims for. The part decorated with flowers that match the opening was also impressive. Well, the Sense Hotel has 7 types of regular rooms, 2 types of suites, and 3 types of top suites. Among the suites, I chose Gyeongbokgung Palace.  The only jacket-tie suite in the Felice with a table was 20, and I was asked about it on the 8th floor. Upon entering the room, the living room is located, and the floor-to-ceiling glass windows are the first thing that catches your eye. You can see the center of South Korea, including Gyeongbokgung Palace and the Blue House, at a glance. The living room space, with its marble floor and bright green carpet, is neat and tidy rather than flashy. The design by the UK\u0027s lkey w design works was inspired by the various aspects of Hanok and created patterns throughout the room. I liked how the unique carpet shape, the grid pattern on the mirror, the paintings on the wall, and the cushion sofa all unified the Korean look. There is an LG LCD TV, and welcome chocolates and cards are provided for the living room table, as well as a quarantine kit. There is a separate office space near the entrance and a place to hang your coat. Following the hallway is the atrium. The bedroom is much larger than the living room, but because it is a suite located in a black corner, it is cool and open with floor-to-ceiling glass on both sides. When you open your eyes from the bed,  Gyeongbokgung Palace is right in front of you. The view from the hotel room is very different. It feels like lying in the center of the world. Since the glass is on both sides, you have to be careful of the pie light, and you have to be careful that you can be insured against eye damage if you don\u0027t close the curtains in the morning. These days, regulars at 5-star hotels have a Simos bed, and my friend\u0027s bed is from the American hotel bedding company So*Vextex. The Korean style was also evident on the wall behind the bed and on the dresser. The vanity mirror hanging on a leather strap was particularly unique. Personally, I prefer rooms with large windows and good lighting. The spaciousness and urban feel were just my style. Between the bedroom and living room is the bathroom and bathtub, which are the highlights of the room. I personally feel stuffy when I\u0027m in hot water, but the view is refreshing. Oh, and the salt that was prepared and the bathtub that I just dazed myself in were healing. The bathtub that was meticulously prepared, with a headrest and a TV, is something even those who don\u0027t like their alma mater can\u0027t help but soak in.  It is a built-in TV in the bathroom with stylish lighting and marble, so you can watch a drama without any interruption in the story while brushing your teeth. Amenities 4 are products from Natural PC, a Spanish skincare brand. Sam \u0026 There is a shower room and toilet separated by a separate partition at the back. Various amenities including toothpaste and slippers are provided. There is a minibar and a space for drinking tea in the hallway at the end of the bathroom. The tea set was very pretty. You can drink the Kim Dong-kwon Ssanggyemyeongcha provided. Lee City 100 from an American organic handmade tea company and espresso coffee capsules are also provided. It is included in the use of the Club Lounge located on the 8th floor of the Pens PU Executive Suite N10. If you go for afternoon tea time, you can have dessert and tea. When I visited, instead of a traditional meal, it was served individually. It was not served on a three-tiered tray like other hotels, but a plate full of delicious desserts was provided. The south and west views that I could not see from the room can be seen in the lounge.  There was a happy hour with unlimited drinks and food, and I hope you\u0027ll believe it and live your life in one of the few places in Seoul that serves champagne. I had breakfast as room service for quarantine reasons. I had Japanese, Western, and Korean food, and they were all delicious without any shortcomings. Rather than moving around diligently from the morning and eating buffet-style, it was better to have a full meal in the room like this. The rooms and lounge are great, but the Four Seasons Hotel is actually more famous for its gym, Spa 4 Canal. It was especially famous for requiring a 100 million won deposit to sign up for a gym membership. The 765-square-meter fitness club was, as expected, the most utilized of all the domestic hotel gyms I\u0027ve been to. Not only was the space large and the view out the window, but there was also a variety of equipment, including socks, workout clothes, swimwear, and disposable head covers. There was nothing to complain about. The pool felt a bit small, but I wasn\u0027t able to take a picture, but the inside of the changing room was amazing. I think it would be a bit of a comparison to the fence at the time, but I personally want to give my hand to the Four Seasons Hotel.  Even if you do n\u0027t like it, if you\u0027re watching Four Seasons Sort 4, I definitely recommend going to the gym. There\u0027s even a screen golf practice range, so it seemed like there were more people who signed up for memberships and used the gym regularly than actual hotel guests. So, what would your overall review be if you were to guess at the Four Seasons Seoul? First of all, it\u0027s definitely my favorite hotel. Personally, I don\u0027t like the hustle and bustle of the city, but the hotel itself was relatively calm, which was nice. The gym was so memorable that I really want to go there again. The staff and service are definitely top-notch in Korea. Above all, when I was promoted to the second stage of social fish and had difficulty using the swimming pool and gym, unlike other hotels, I was impressed that they gave me a pass that I could use after the next stage. I also liked that it\u0027s full of great restaurants, including a Michelin one-star Chinese restaurant. However, there are definitely downsides. The interior, which has a traditional Korean feel, is nice, but it doesn\u0027t really feel young, so my parents would prefer it. I actually thought that foreigners would really like it more than Koreans. Also, while the location is in the heart of Seoul, you should keep in mind that if you make a mistake, noise can creep up.  And because of the location, you can\u0027t help but see the office and the office workers running around, so it\u0027s not the right place for those who want to get away from the city without thinking much. But I want to go there again. If you like today\u0027s video, please subscribe and like.

{"video_id":"JruvXkmXF9I","lang":"en","full_text":"hello I\u0027m your guardian angel here in Korea and I\u0027m here to help you with everything you need to know about Korea okay very important thing right when you plan your trip accommodation is very very important right so you have to choose the right place to stay otherwise if you pick the wrong place oh no yes it can ruin your trouble right so I\u0027m going to give you three recommendations for you the areas I think that would be perfect for you to stay while in Salt by the way I did my first the video on accommodations before and if you haven\u0027t watched it you can watch it here I have talked about three hidden locations for my previous video so here come my three picks again okay are you ready so let\u0027s begin number one Yan have you heard of yungan well yungan may not be a tourist area but it\u0027s a very very immersing neighborhood in sa and a lot of facilities are opening up in yungan and of course hotels yes hotels are opening up in Yan too so the hotels are very new and also it\u0027s very good value so if your priority is good value and also location yungan is the place why location because yungan is near the city center yungan is not exactly in the center but it\u0027s near the center so you can get to any place you want to go to like K or or yes yungan is in central s so you can get to those places easily and as I said it has a good value there a lot of hotels that offer you good value so you can search for hotels in yungan and I think you you define because yungan as I said in central soul and you are already close to many tourist attractions of the city for example the national museum of Korea is in yungan and also the war memorial of Korea is in yungan too and have you heard of an Tower Namsan Tower yes Namsan Tower is the tallest tower in Soul and it offers stunning views of the whole city right so you can get to Namsan by use taking the cable car and then you can see the view yes the end Tower Namsan Tower is on in yongan too so you have lots of tourist attractions nearby right and also if you are into Korea\u0027s nightlife you can visit itwan itan is also in yungan too oh there are many things to do yes there are many things to do in yungan as I said it\u0027s an immersing and verying neighborhood in sou and by the way if you are in yungan hit Yung Yung is a Street full of captivating cafes and restaurants it stretches from shinan station to S station yes it\u0027s a popular hangout among locals and you will see a lot of young people going to Trend de cafes and restaurants and bars in yungang area and lastly yungan is also a good place for shopping too they have I park mall it\u0027s a massive Mall and they have a lot of shops restaurants and movie theater and that shopping center is very famous among foreigners too I have seen lots of boring tourists there so if you\u0027re into shopping yuman I park mall would be the choice for you so yuman as I said in central sou it is served by many Subway Lines including number one number four and Chang night and also there are a lot of buses and it\u0027s easy to take taxes so public loc and public transportation is very good in yungan and also if you want to travel outside of Sal there is train station yungan station you can take trains from yungan station so it will be very good to travel and get to any places any place you want to go to so how to get there from the inter International Airport you can take the ax airport uh railroad Express to so Y and soul station and then you can transfer to subway line number number one or line number four to K number two Cham if you are traveling with your family oh Cham you should know Cham Cham would be a perfect place to be because Chu is full of activities alltime activities when it rains it\u0027s okay because it has a lot of indoor amusement facilities for instance they have L world Adventure the nation the country\u0027s biggest amusement park I mean indoor amusement park and also the lot Tower maybe you have heard of it l Tower is the tallest building and it\u0027s a 123 story building and they have the sky Observatory right yes it\u0027s an amazing view from the top and also they have department stores in the tower and also good restaurants in the tower so if you are with your children it would be a good place to be because it has everything and although we are not traveling with children CH is a good place to be because there isan tanil is an area um that has a lot of um good cafes and restaurants and a lot of locals go there during the weekends to visit you know the country\u0027s finest restaurants there I mean not like M mang like finest thing but they\u0027re good restaurants there and you know you are also close to Nature in CH s Lake it\u0027s an artificial Lake but it\u0027s a beautiful one and it is very famous for cherry blossoms in Spring and the cherry blossom trees turn their colors so beautiful in the fall so it\u0027s a good area to take a walk and to take pictures and by the way speaking of nature there is Olympic Park as well Olympic Park is such a massive Park and you can go there since it\u0027s near Cham area and lastly if you\u0027re are fan of baseball chamel is the something that you should know because chamel is home to the country to very famous baseball teams LG Twins and Tuan Bears even if you are not fan of baseball it\u0027s okay because it is an experience there are a lot of energetic and fanatic Korean fans so the baseball stadium oh it will be very very loud a lot of chant and a lot of cheer reading and dancing so it will be a very unique local experience while in chamil try all these activities and chamil is in Southern Soul and it\u0027s not in the center it\u0027s more of a local Ambiance but it is served by many public transportation means such as subway bus yes you can take lots of buses to Guru chami and Subway there are two subway stations nearby one chami subway line number two and line eight and suon station line number nine so it\u0027s easy to move around even if you stay in chami and also to get there from the international airport it\u0027s so easy just take a bus limousine bus and there are two buses going there 675a and 6200 that go straight to chamu from the international airport so it will be easy to get there number three ton tund Moon yes it\u0027s more known uh compared to yungan and ch right you should know T if you\u0027re are interested in shopping and also eating out yes tun is known for shopping they have a lot of shopping malls like tuta or medor and they open until so late like 2:00 a.m. or something and some of the shopping Ms open 24 hours so yes you can shop there and then also there will be street food vendors outside of shopping malls and also at traditional markets in t too so you can enjoy Korea\u0027s food day and night and one of the things I recommend for you to try is takari yes takari is in Korean whole chicken yes takari is whole chicken but we kind of boil them and then you know after you eat meat we use the BR us to make k k as a sick midle and there is an Al specializing in takari right next to T market so there are things a lot of things to do while in tund other than shopping and also you are in Central Soul a bit Northeast of of the kukun palace so you are close to ancient temp ancient palaces and also other tourist attractions for those of you interested in history you can visit tun history and culture park and if you are into New Soul there is a landmark DDP T design Plaza designed by the famous J hadit yes it\u0027s a new advent I mean landmark in sou and you can go there to see art exhibitions and cultural exhibitions held in the plaza T is located in C Soul as I said so it is easily accessible by public transport oh there are subway stations three stations in the area one is T Station served by line number one and four and T Station line number one and six and chumu station line number three and four and other than the Subways of course there are buses of course so you can get there easily and from the intern International Airport the best way is to go

go breakfast is served at the Grand kitchen every morning the breakfast experience at the Intercontinental Grandpa nurse is nothing short of extraordinary the hotel\u0027s Chef takes great pride in curating a breakfast spread that caters to every palette and preferences whether you\u0027re a fan of traditional morning Classics or have a pension for international flavors the Intercontinental Grand Partners has it all for those seeking a lighter option the hotel takes great care in presenting an enticing assortment of freshly cut fruits and a variety of healthy cereals yogurts and granola foreign [Music] the dining area provides a welcoming and relaxed atmosphere where guests can enjoy their breakfast at their own pace you can choose to sit indoors surrounded by elegant Decor or Venture Outdoors to savor your meals with a breathtaking view of the city\u0027s guidelines albeit it was a bit cold during my stay it was about negative 2 degrees so indoors it is for me alright let\u0027s talk about the on-site amenities specifically the fitness center so interestingly the fitness club is separated into gentlemen and ladies I\u0027m a gentleman so I would not go to the ladies side but the gentleman\u0027s side is this way so you gotta change into these first but we\u0027ll check out the simple energy and there\u0027s a locker area indoor swimming pool very cool I guess the Korean people are really really into Health um I did not take a shot off the gym because it was really really full every single equipment was taken up and by all means it\u0027s not a small gym it\u0027s actually very big but you have a lot of people at the gym they\u0027re working out there\u0027s a lot of elderlies doing aerobics as well so yeah they\u0027re all very into fitness there is also a sauna room and a lounge area but that\u0027s pretty much about it the swimming pool is actually heated and it\u0027s very very warm so I decided to get out from there immediately so the view from the room is this so that is coax and if you can see in The Far Side there is our friend the Intercontinental coax actually which is connected to the mall just like this hotel here as well so yeah great place to stay so that was the Intercontinental Hotel grandpana\u0027s so overall fantastic hotel and I can definitely see why people think this is one of the best Intercontinental Hotel out there and definitely it could be one of the main reasons why I will come back to Seoul again anyways guys I\u0027m in intro on Terminal 1 right now I\u0027m gonna catch my flight I\u0027m not gonna tell you what side it is so you gotta stay tuned for that and uh yeah please do like this video if you find it helpful and please subscribe to the channel as I\u0027ll be bringing you more content

Jos Dynasty and transformed into a commercial hub in the early 20th century so the name Yong itself means bright cave symbolizing the district as a beacon of Commerce and culture and soul and the main thing to do here is shop there are so many shops around everything from high-end Brands to Kate Beauty to Korean beauty Boutique shops okay if you\u0027re looking for some souvenirs these almonds are

in bulk like you can get a bunch of masks and get some discounts and a lot of times they\u0027re out side uh giving out some free samples and masks if you buy something in the store and their stores

toks or Instagram reals of people eating here so many food stalls here and there\u0027s something for everyone bring us some cash so you can eat at some of these places some places do take hard and

{"video_id":"bu2-NoPnlHg","lang":"en-CA","full_text":"We’re moving out of our terrible Airbnb and into a 5-star hotel in Seoul. The Airbnb location was central and the space was big; however, the reason I call it terrible is because of the horrible sewer smell. It gets worse whenever we use the shower or sink, so I had to remove all my skincare and toothbrush from the bathroom and use the kitchen sink instead. If I had to describe the smell, I’d say it smelled like vomit. We’re both surprised that none of the reviews mentioned this. The host admitted she was fully aware of the smell and told us to directly file a complaint with the building’s management office… which is ridiculous and unacceptable! We’re definitely leaving an honest review so others will know before booking. Jason decided to order a Kakao Taxi because we had so much luggage, and Kakao offers a van option, while Uber in Korea doesn\u0027t provide that. We’re heading to the Shilla Hotel in Seoul for 6 days and 5 nights, paying $600 a night. If you want to spot celebrities, this is one of the hotels they often stay at. With its perfect blend of traditional, heritage-inspired style—reflecting its dynastic roots —and contemporary design, the Shilla Seoul truly balances past, present, and future. The moment we got out of our taxi, we were immediately greeted by professionals in suits who helped us every step of the way. One thing I noticed is that their service really is top-notch. Shilla provided some of the best hospitality we’ve ever experienced at a high-end hotel. The lobby looked mesmerizing with its famous hanging crystals. Since we arrived earlier than our check-in time, we just dropped off our bags and went out for lunch. We decided to check out the Shilla Duty Free mall, but I was quickly stopped and told not to film. In Korea, taking photos or videos are quite sensitive matter. Even in public, you need consent; that’s why most Korean influencers blur people’s faces so they won’t get sued. I find it a bit ridiculous, considering there are CCTV cameras and vehicles with black boxes recording everywhere in Korea. But then again, Korea has huge issues with “Molka,” which means hidden camera. People sometimes film others without consent in public places for bad reasons. For instance, spy cameras have created fear among women about being filmed without knowing. This made filming tricky, but I tried my best to avoid any problems. We didn’t see anything good to eat in the Duty Free mall, so we went outside the Shilla Hotel. Jason found this hidden “gem” restaurant we really enjoyed; the menu was simple, prices were reasonable, and the portions were huge. Hey guys, so I just want to say that the Shilla Hotel is actually on a hill. So they do offer a bunch of like shuttle bus services like from a bunch of locations. So you don\u0027t have to go up those big hills. And they\u0027re quite convenient and comfortable. They offer free buses to popular areas like Myeongdong too. Once we got back to our hotel, they gave us the keys and mentioned our bags were already in the room. The room was honestly pretty spacious to me. Plus, we had the best view of Namsan Tower every morning. I think this hotel has, like the best view of Namsan Tower. We didn’t want to head out again, and since our wedding is tomorrow, so we decided to order room service instead. Jason got the samgyetang (a traditional Korean chicken soup) for ₩65,000, and I ordered a phat Thai for ₩42,000. And then our wedding happened! If you’d like to see our wedding day vlog, the link will be in the description below! Good morning. Looks like we overslept. It\u0027s like already 11:30am. But, today I really want to take some time to really check out the hotel. I’ll go to the gym and try their food. So come join me today. To start off the day, we had lunch at the Library Lounge on the first floor. So we’re at the library. Koreans are quite particular about what you film. So I don\u0027t want to film other people’s faces right now. I’ll film the food. While we were waiting for our food, we got a ridiculous request from our Airbnb host, asking us to rate them 5 stars in exchange for a Starbucks gift card. How can they try to bribe us for a fake review? Tsk tsk tsk. Don’t worry—we wrote a very honest review despite So this is our Airbnb, umm so it says , like, you know a five star review event so that you get a Starbucks gift card. As long as you put a five star, but if it\u0027s a  five star review only. Because I was so confused, right? Because like, we had that smell issue and I scanned through all of the reviews. I would not give them a five star. I scanned through all of their reviews and not a single place mention this smell. So I was like, oh, is a new thing? But then I found out that it\u0027s like it\u0027s always been there. So I\u0027m surprised..but that\u0027s why, because they are giving... they are doing this 5 star review thing where like... And then, the same thing for my mom’s Airbnb where like if you give a positive review, you get a Starbucks gift card. So I guess that\u0027s what they\u0027re doing at Airbnb now. That\u0027s why there are so many places with five star reviews But they don\u0027t deserve the five star. Yeah yeah because they are doing this, we are going to give you this gift card. I guess it works for them, right? It makes sense. They just give a five stars. But that\u0027s bribing people! It\u0027s like a $5 gift card, I am assuming...but I ordered their chargrilled Korean beef cheeseburger for a whopping ₩52,000, while Jason got the Croque Monsieur for ₩43,000. The fries were crispy and tasty, kind of like McDonald’s fries. The portions were perfect, but honestly, at these prices, I should’ve just gone somewhere cheaper. The food tasted average, nothing particularly special. But the real reason we came here was to try Shilla\u0027s famous and super expensive bingsoo, Korean shaved ice cream. It’s been on my Korea bucket list for awhile. The one I wanted to try was mango, but it’s seasonal, so the one they had during our visit was the Honeycomb Bingsu, called “Bingsky.” They include cacao nibs cookies and Jirisan Mountain’s wild honey, which is collected only once a year after the first frost of winter. It’s said to be one of the best honeys in Korea because it’s rich in propolis, pollen, and wax from wild bees that feed on hundreds of flowers in Jirisan Mountain’s pollution-free areas at altitudes higher than 600 meters from spring to fall. It costs ₩68,000 or ₩118,000 with whiskey. It was HUGE, and we immediately regretted eating lunch first. Honestly, it’s best shared with four people, especially since the sides have free refills. We didn’t ask for more because it was already too much for the two of us. The honey was insanely sweet and rich. The honeycomb itself didn’t have that waxy flavour most honeycombs have. In one phrase: it was as pure as honey can get. There were so many flavours and combinations you could make with all the sides, so we never got sick of just one taste. This is the big honeycomb that I am going to eat. Oh, It’s pure honey. I don\u0027t even taste the wax. It\u0027s just like pure honey. It just melts in your mouth. But...it genuinely taste different than the honey I’ve gotten in Canada. I can actually tell the difference. No. For sure, I’ve never tasted this kind of honey before. I guess this is what real honey taste like? So cold. I\u0027m so glad you brought the jacket down because I’m freezing. Now that we\u0027re eating this, I\u0027m, like, so much colder. I can make you tea upstairs. You don’t want tea? It’s a lot of liquid already Yeah, but it’s good for your throat no? I guess. Remember we are eating again in 3 hours. It’s not not even three hours, it’s 3 o’clock (Dinner at 5PM) We\u0027re leaving in, like, two hours for dinner. We really tried to finish as much as possible, but we still ended up leaving about half. At least, we finished all the honey, which is where the real value is. Was it worth it? Definitely worth trying once, because you can pay a lot for honey alone, but it’s not easy to get fresh honeycomb from that area. After eating, we checked out Shilla’s amenities and the gym. Okay, we\u0027re going to go to the gym now. The entire place is beautifully decorated with crystal accents. They were pretty strict about filming, so I couldn’t record much. They have a Korean sauna, spa, beauty salon, a huge gym with physicians on standby, plus a walking path, pilates studio, golf range, indoor pool, and a rooftop pool /cabana. During our stay, we saw like polices and bodyguards all over our hotel. I think some famous people like politicians and maybe even the president of Korea are here attending the weddings. I didn’t want to get in trouble, so I didn’t film anything. There’s another wedding today? There’s a lot of weddings happening. Did you say it’s fully booked? Every weekend is fully booked until 2025, I believe. Wow. Yeah, it’s a $127,000 just to rent. Walking around to digest what we ate. Not long after, it was dinner time! Around 4:50 PM, the first floor got packed with a line out the door for the famous Parkview Buffet at Shilla. It’s known as one of the most luxurious buffets in Seoul, priced at a steep ₩192,000 per person for dinner. We were seated and given a free bottle of San Pellegrino along with a choice of one glass of wine per person. It seems I lost some of my video footage, but the buffet included nine sections like fresh seafood like snow crabs, and sushi. Western cuisine like pasta, pizza, and seafood. Asian cuisine, specifically Chinese wok items. Vietnamese pho noodles Grilled meat and seafood Chinese dim sum and fried foods Korean side dishes Fresh veggies and salads And of course, dessert Because of the time limit, everyone rushed in to grab food, and it was actually a bit of a shit show. We started with fresh seafoods, then the grilled meats and seafoods. While we were eating, they brought a mushroom cream pie soup to each person. I didn’t eat it, but Jason tried some. He said it was super heavy, basically pure cream, and the pastry on top was really buttery. It\u0027s probably a trap to fill you up since you know you\u0027re paying a lot of money. But Jason said it tasted good, just not worth the stomach real estate. We sampled a bit of everything, but the roasted tenderloin and rack of lamb with mint sauce were the best bang for your buck and Jason’s favourites. Once we were nearly full, we moved on to the last section: desserts, which had pastries, chocolate, cheese, fruit, and jello. Overall, the food was delicious but not worth the amount we paid for. I’ll post a video in the future about another buffet we went to in Korea that we thought was really worth it. Let’s just say it involved unlimited caviar! Subscribe so you don’t miss that video when I post it. Mont-blanc Towards the end, right before we had to leave, they handed us the bill. Since we were staying at the Shilla Hotel, we got a free $100 discount on the buffet! Our total bill ended up at 285,000 won. After we finished eating, we opened our wedding gifts, checking each envelope one by one. In asian culture, we recorded everything in a book. so we can keep track who gave how much. So we found a fancy envelope out of all of these envelopes that we\u0027ve opened up. Among them, one of them was the fanciest and the most touching one was another that really stood out."}
{"video_id":"_6WNOKhIGkI","lang":"en","full_text":"A private pool has appeared in the middle of Gangnam. What are you talking about? In the past, Ark Ambassador Sword actor Barry Marriott redeveloped a 4-star A Easy Fellow. Let\u0027s find out together what it will look like when it returns. [Music] Hello, I\u0027m a man again. It\u0027s a common cancer. In the middle of Gangnam, Seoul, A Short by Marriott Seoul Gangnam has opened. This is the famous air-conditioned guesthouse in Insadong, where the White Sunny operated by Boksil used to be a Mercure Hotel. After a major remodel, it changed its sign to an AC Hotel, a select line of Marriott, and was able to reopen on March 22. Some people joke that A Short, a brand unfamiliar to us, is Air Show Terry. In 1997, the founder Antonio Dalan opened a European-style hotel brand in Madrid, Spain, taking the first letters of Dalan. Well, the A Short by Marriott Seoul Gangnam, known as the hotel of Quixote, Caesar, and Charity, became an even bigger issue when it came to the comeback and the sound. The reason it was even more talked about was that it had no rooms with pools.  Thanks to Song, it has five rooms with private pools, one of which is a suite. In addition, there are suites without private pools, and a total of 265 seals are prepared for general rooms. Let\u0027s check in and see what the actual ACO frame looks like. Unlike the outside of the plain, the first floor lobby has a very elegant atmosphere. The A shot itself pursues a sophisticated European sensibility, and many parts were meticulously designed, so even though the beam is small, the atmosphere is not inferior to that of a five-star hotel. It is said that artworks by Sim So, Kim Hyun-il, Yoo-i, Song Ja, etc. are displayed throughout. It was surprising that a welcome drink was provided when checking in, but why was gum jelly provided? All guests are provided with something called a \"Padde Pool,\" and it was fun to spray the concentrate with a dropper. Robin is located on the side of the front desk for check-in, and the media Salome is located. The AC Lounge, which is located at the front, is a large space that all guests can use. A simple tea is provided from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. The hotel  It \u0027s decorated so luxuriously that it could be used as a restaurant or bar. It\u0027s expected that the hotel\u0027s most desirable space wasn\u0027t used as a cold store, but as a space for all guests to use. I also used it very well, doing work and having a cup of coffee. Inside, there\u0027s a Premier Lounge where Pia Hour is held, and next to it is a media salon that can actually be used. The room I stayed in on my first day was a Premier App Room, one of five rooms with a private pool. The room itself was the same size and structure as the other rooms in the hotel. However, unlike the regular rooms, there\u0027s an outdoor space, and there\u0027s a private pool there for guests. It\u0027s not a size you\u0027d want to work in, and the depth is a bit disappointing. It\u0027s a good place to come with children who are just right for talking outdoors, as if it were a Jacuzzi. The outside of the private pool is covered with landscaping instead of a view. This is because all five rooms with pools are located on the third floor, facing neighboring buildings. To protect the privacy of the building, the front is completely blocked. From the hotel\u0027s perspective, the third floor is an awkward place to match rooms.  It seems like a smart decision to install it in the pool on the lower floors, so they can sell the rooms at a higher price. In the case of the only Premier App Suite in the hotel, it is exactly twice as large as two regular Premier App rooms attached. There is a table and sofa in front of the private room, so even if you don\u0027t swim, it\u0027s nice to sit and read a book or eat while watching the water ripple. At night, the lights are colorful. I\u0027m concerned about the corners of the stairs in the Haman pool, but considering that I\u0027ll be using it with children, it would be nice if the 10th floor was secure. Although they said there was a pool, the room itself was very small. In fact, you shouldn\u0027t expect the size of a 5-star room in a 4-star business hotel. The open bathroom reminded me of the Mondrian 5 Tree in Itaewon. Instead, the floor and furniture are in warm brown tones, creating a comfortable atmosphere. I personally liked the clean and modern sensibility of the bed headboard, the lights, and the paintings hanging above it. Instead of a work desk, a round table and chairs are placed by the window. Thanks to the private pool, there is no separate electric kettle.  Although it is not exact, the view of the swimming pool outside gave it an exotic feeling, as if I was traveling. In keeping with the times, a SESCO UV power air sterilizer was also provided. The bathroom is narrow as the room is narrow, but it is open and not separated from the bedroom by 9 minutes. The sink is one unit, and the shower booth and toilet are separate. The amenities are from Corex, a Greek natural ingredient cosmetics brand, and they say that in the future, they will be provided in a small container. If you want to separate the bedroom and bathroom, you can close the door installed in the middle to separate the space. There is a mini fine espresso coffee machine at the entrance, as well as electric boat tea and cups. All drinks in the refrigerator are free for guests staying in the Suite and Premier Plus rooms. The Prim you just saw is in the front room. Only 9 rooms in the hotel have a special structure, and all other standard rooms are the same size and structure. The Superior Room faces the building in front without a view, while the Deluxe and Premier Rooms have a view of the residential area in Yeoksang-dong. You can use the room for free only if you stay in a Deluxe or higher room. In addition, on the second day, I stayed in the Tuscan Premium Room.  The difference is that it comes with an additional Seragem massage chair or sofa bed, as well as a capsule coffee machine. The bathroom is the same as the Premier Pool, which we saw earlier. Inside, some rooms have bathtubs, depending on the room. The toilet and sink are attached, and you can shower in the bathtub. Since it\u0027s not an open bathroom, the space can feel a bit cramped, so you can request one at check-in to be assigned according to your preference. Breakfast is served in the AC Kitchen on the first floor, which is mixed in with the table sack and the sofa inside. Meats include pork belly and chicken, which are very thin and taste like bacon, as well as various salads and Korean side dishes. You have to make your own rice noodles, but egg dishes are provided at the live station. If you approach it with the expectations of a 4-star hotel buffet, the variety of options was good, and the variety of cakes for dessert was particularly impressive. Happy hour is available at the Premier Lounge, which we showed you in the first-floor lobby earlier. The space itself is dark and small since the Premier was opened, so it\u0027s not as spacious as the AC Down Sea, which is available to all guests.  There was n\u0027t a standout menu during happy hour, but there were quite a few choices, so I was full after eating a lot. However, there wasn\u0027t really anything that could be called a main menu, so it\u0027s a bit lacking in the feeling of having a meal. In addition, since it overlaps with the caution menu, the menu is quite large, so if you\u0027re planning on having breakfast, it might be better not to use it. In addition, Otrun also operates Cloud Rooftop Papa on the 11th floor. There are many fitting centers, although there are no shorts in the gym. It\u0027s located on the basement level, and although it\u0027s not large enough for the size of the hotel, it\u0027s not really a 9-jang Manchon 1s gym. There were 4 aerobic machines, a matrix strength training machine, a promotion machine, and a hoist machine. Since the space is small, there were machines that allowed for various exercises with one machine, which was a bit unfamiliar and interesting. There\u0027s a sauna next to the gym. It\u0027s not big, but if you like saunas, it\u0027s worth a visit. There\u0027s Little Champion on the 3rd floor, which is great for children. You have to pay a separate fee to use it, but in fact, the 3rd floor is where the private pring rooms are located, so the Little Champion can make a bit of a commotion during the hours. If you\u0027re going to stay in your room, just be quiet.  I think it would be a good idea to do so. In fact, many people with Marriott membership levels must have been excited when the existing Accor hotels, such as Mercure Sodowe and Marriott Resolve, reopened. However, unlike other Marriott hotels, the ACO frame provides somewhat poor service to Marriott members. Normally, if you are Platinum or higher, breakfast and lounge access are free, but A Short does not provide breakfast except for the first visit. Originally, breakfast was not provided even for the first visit, but it seems to reflect public sentiment and is provided at least once. I thought they are making an effort since they provide various options for tier benefits. If so, what would be your overall review of A Short by Marriott Seoul Gangnam? It is said that a snake\u0027s head can be better than a dragon\u0027s tail. Remember, the H5 frame is a 4-star. First of all, it seems infinitely lacking compared to the last hotels. However, it is not as infinitely lacking as you might think. In fact, the 4-star hotel staff is very nice. I think it is better than the old and outdated 5-star last. It is a pity that the rooms are a bit small, but  It\u0027s hard to expect much from a business hotel in the heart of Gangnam, a prime location. Instead, the hotel offers a well-appointed lobby and AC lounge, allowing guests to experience a partial 5-star feel in a 4-star hotel. It\u0027s particularly good for workcations for office workers who don\u0027t work from home, or for college students studying for assignments or exams. For someone like me who loves older brothers, the lack of a pool is a bit disappointing. However, for those who don\u0027t even go near the older brother\u0027s house and feel a sense of waste every time they attack, it might be more reasonable. On the other hand, there\u0027s also a sauna, which is occasionally helpful. The front desk offers fun \"A Shot\" services like \"The Pouch\" and \"Welcome Charlie.\" Breakfast is reasonable for the price, and it\u0027s nice that you can choose your options. If you\u0027re feeling overwhelmed by the 5-star hotel and want to relax outside, I recommend it. For a \"Hoppang\" experience, you should book a deluxe room, which is at least 50 million won cheaper. There are subtle differences between rooms, so it \u0027s a good idea to take note of the differences and your risk preferences before making a reservation or checking in. ( Based on Marriott\u0027s official website, weekday prices)  It seems to be around 170,000 to 190,000 won, but there will definitely be promotions here and there. I think you\u0027ll be satisfied with a price under 100,000 won, including coupons. The price is too high for a room with a private pool. Honestly, it\u0027s definitely not worth spending 500,000 to 600,000 won. Instead, it could be a good option for those who find it too much of a hassle to go all the way to a church or a pool villa, or for those who are looking for a place to play in the water with children. However, the rooms are small, so it seems that it can accommodate a baby or one child who runs around a lot, so I don\u0027t recommend it for parties because the rooms are too small. If you enjoyed the video and found it helpful for your trip, please subscribe, like, and turn on notifications. In the next video, I \u0027ll be back with a review of all the rooms on the cruise, including a trip to Ulleungdo where I enjoy steamed buns instead of motion sickness. Then, I\u0027ve been a man who has left, but I\u0027ve also earned money from others. Thank you. [Music]"}

{"video_id":"GCm_n2Ouacs","lang":"en","full_text":"[Music] welcome back to the channel my name is shelle and in this video we are on our way to the Grand Hyatt iton this is our last hotel that we stayed at in Soul so I wanted to share this location as it is close to the airport we decided to take a taxi to the Grand Hyatt because it wasn\u0027t that bad of a ride it was about 30 minutes without traffic 40 minutes depending if there was traffic and it was about 22 us D so it wasn\u0027t a terrible ride and since we did have a lot of suitcases we thought this was the best option this High location is a part of the Category 3 so we were able to use a free night for this hotel um I do recommend signing up for the Hyatt Rewards program as you can earn free nights to stay at different hotels all around the world and this is the hotel I use my free night on my sister is also a member and she used her free night while we stayed in Soul the Grand Hyatt is a massive Hotel made up of two towers East and West the main reason we stayed here because they offer a free shuttle to the airport which is a game changer I do like to stay close to the airport the day before we\u0027re about to leave as it makes the train transit to the airport very seamless the hotel offers a number of cafes and restaurants where you can eat at so you really don\u0027t have to leave the hotel if you don\u0027t want to because there\u0027s places to eat with inside within the hotel before before going up to the room I wanted to check out the hotel which was something we weren\u0027t able to do last time we stayed here they have this beautiful staircase which is great for pictures as well as different artwork around the hotel and I love that they have this these seating areas around the hotel so that you really don\u0027t have to be confined to your room you can really just walk from Tower to Tower and experience the hotel it is such a relaxing place to be one thing I wanted to show this time that I wasn\u0027t able to see last time is the business center you can go in here at any time to visit the business center and they have a computer and printer so if you need to print out boarding passes or any uh information you\u0027re able to do that and it was never crowded in here so I think this is a good addition to the hotel I wasn\u0027t sure if this was here last time but I was able to see it on this visit the East and West towers are connected by a walkway so you don\u0027t really have to go outside which is a good addition as this walkway is air conditioned when you walk through the walkway you\u0027ll be passing the area to enter the Garden area they also have a pool and there was a children\u0027s area too so we\u0027re going to walk over to the East Tower it\u0027s a very Serene experience I think this Tower is more so for conferences and they have additional restaurants over in this uh Tower the pool was closed this time uh we were here was actually closed last time we here we just don\u0027t have the best luck but when I stay here next time I\u0027ll be sure to experience the pool and let you know how it is when you walk past the pool you\u0027ll see that there\u0027s a ton of sitting spaces there was it was very quiet here and it was a lot of places to take pictures they have artwork on the first floor that we saw last time we were here but I thought this was a great time to go to their Cafe on this side they had a bakery that I really wanted to try and me and my sister decided to pick up some delicious chocolate chip cookies which I would recommend this uh Cafe area for desserts and they had um wine and different beverages as well if you wanted more grab and go time type of snacks there are two convenience stores located within walking distance of the hotel so this is a great location even if you don\u0027t want to eat within the restaurants inside during our stay here we stayed in a two twin bed uh stay we use one of my free nights here this is a category 4 so I do recommend always looking at the categories for your highed hotels to see if you can always redeem those reward nights we stayed here for one night before leaving out to come home to um to the state this is a great Hotel I would recommend this if you\u0027re looking to stay near the airport because the shuttle is a benefit of the hotel it was very clean quiet and I always love the rooms here this room offers a very spacious bathroom which is a walking bathroom with shower and tub enough for two people we were able to come in here they provided robes and slippers which I always love as we had most of our items packed up I love the lighting in this bathroom and it leads right into the bedroom across from the bathroom is this closet area which you can store your suitcases there is the second rub as well as an iron and your safe is in there as well next to the closet is going to be your tea area as well as a frigerator and we did utilize the teapot we actually went to the convenience store and got ramen which uh I love cup Ramen from the convenience stores here and we got drinks to share the drinks here are not provided by the hotel you they are at C so I do recommend being mindful if you choose to take one and the room is made up of two twin beds I would say these are a little bit um wider than a traditional twin so there has plenty of room the bed was soft and comfy as well as the pillows um this was a gloomy day so the lighting is not as bright as we would like but we decided to make the best of it and still try to walk around the area our view is of the parking lot as well as the uh Landing Strip to the airport right next to the door is going to be your floor to ceiling mirror there\u0027s also a place for you to put your shoes uh we decided to put our shoes behind us until we realized that there was a rack right in front of us and that\u0027s where you can also put your slippers to when you\u0027re not using them we did decide to walk to the convenience store and we borrowed an umbrella from the hotel which was very nice to them they actually had a whole bunch of umbrellas that you can borrow since it was raining and we walked over to the convenience store which was about a 5 7 minute walk on the way back from the conven store we actually did get caught in the rain so we actually waited around a little bit for the rain to stop until we walk back to the hotel I would say this is one of my favorite hotels to stay at near the airport as it is convenient and they have things to do in the hotel hotel in somewhat around the hotel but the shuttle is the main reason we love staying here because we don\u0027t have to worry about how we\u0027re getting to the airport the hotel offers a ton of seating areas these seating areas were right next to the window where you could sit and read a book or eat your meal there were also um sitting areas downstairs by Lobby and check-in area which were never crowded and I also decided to take some pictures here on the balcony or stair area as this was one of the connecting areas as well to the hotels we decided to go back up to the room and eat our cookies which were delicious I 10 out of 10 recommend these cookies as they were very soft and chewy we had an early morning flight back to the state so we wanted to get downstairs early the shuttle does start around 5:00 a.m. um our flight was leaving around 9:30 but we did want to get to the airport early to do some additional shopping the shuttle takes about 10 minutes to get to the airport you just want to be mindful of what bus you\u0027re getting on certain buses only go to certain terminals so we wanted to wait till the bus came for the international terminal which pulled up very shortly and it only took about 10 minutes like I said to get to the [Music] airport the seats on the shuttle were so comfortable and the bus is air conditioned so you can have a nice nice cool ride to the airport it was very nice and relaxing and the sun started to come up so we were able to see a lot more of the property as we were leaving and go to the airport [Music] [Music] I do enjoy always staying at the Grand high in iton there\u0027s not a ton of things to do in this area but there are nice relaxing things where you can walk around and there is a stop a train stop outside so you can take the train to different areas in iton so you can get food or just stay in the area to relax before flying home [Music] the grand Hyatt iton has also signage so just be mindful if you\u0027re staying at this hotel when you land in iton you can just wait by this sign and you can catch the shuttle to the hotel I hope you enjoyed our review of the grand high at ichon near the ichon airport we are flying Korean Air home so please consider subscribing to our Channel as we have more travel content coming your way like this video and share it with a friend as it helps us grow here on on

{"video_id":"wuam05MD4xU","lang":"en","full_text":"Andaz is a brand that I really enjoy,  but this property in Seoul simply doesn’t live up to the brands upscale reputation. Hi there, my name is Kevin. This channel came from a love of traveling, a love of the full  process and the journey itself. I feature airline trip reports and high end hotel reviews from all  over the world. My reviews aren’t sponsored by airlines or hotels so you can be sure to get  my unbiased honest opinion. Am I an expert? You can decide. Am I fair? Yea, I am. Let’s get into it, welcome to Seoul. If you’d like to know the exact  nightly rate that I paid for my stay or my next five videos in queue,  please check out the description below. The Andaz Gangnam has two entrances. In the  front for pedestrians and in the rear there is a driveway for car pickup and drop offs. Note  that despite the hotel doing quite a good job with their photography angles, the hotel does have  an elevated roadway directly in front of it. When checking in, you’ll have a seat at one of  the front desks, which are awkwardly too low and you’ll be offered a cup of tea. Service at check  in and throughout most, but not all of the hotel is in a characteristic American Hyatt familiar  conversational manner, at least in English. Andaz, in Hindi, means personal style and so,  each property is designed to blend the style of it’s specific location with that of the target  customer. It’s not to my personal taste but, I do think it accomplishes this pretty well in the  colors, textures and shapes used throughout the property, but… I’m not a fan of the ground  floor and connecting first floor layout. For a hotel with 241 rooms, the lobby footprint  is on the smaller side as it is, but then when you put this giant centerpiece of a staircase smack in  the middle of it- it just begs the question, why? The hotel is located in central Seoul in it’s name  sake Gangnam district, in the northern part of it. By taxi, you can expect a drive to either  Gimpo or Incheon to take a solid hour or more, but the hotel is located just next to the  Apgujeong Metro station and is on a street that is literally lined with cosmetic surgery clinics. In the rear of the lobby is A-Z Cafe and Gallery offering a variety of pastries  and drinks throughout the day. On the other side of the stair case we have  the elevators which will take us to the guest room floors. I booked a balcony King room and  in retrospect, I’d not book the balcony unless you really need it, simply because the balcony  rooms are all in the annex building of sorts which means you’ll be guaranteed a low floor room. On the left is the primary hotel tower and the three levels of balcony rooms  are in this shorter structure. The corridors like most of the property are  stark and modern but through a mixed palette of neutral tones and well placed lighting,  it never feels particularly barren or cold. Throughout the hotel and especially inside the rooms the asymmetric angles are meant to  reference the patchwork quality of bojagi. Bojagi are the traditional Korean  wrapping cloths used in significant ceremonies as gift wrap to preserve good luck,  according to traditional Korean folklore. Inside the room, the room itself has angled  walls and an oddly shaped bathroom which I think puts form over function. Overall the room is comfortable and nicely equipped for the size, but  considering this hotel just opened in 2019, it’s clear that using quality materials  was not the MO of the designers here. The room has a smart tablet next to the bedside  which is meant to perform all of the in room functions, but in English at least, it’s certainly  not the most efficient way to get things done. The mini bar area is nicely  laid out and compartmentalized. I always think it’s nice when you can  sort of put the mini bar facilities away. As is a brand standard for Andaz, mini bar snacks  and drinks are free, but when I checked in, there was no mention of this at all. I’ve  read recently that Andaz is “reimagining” their minibars so in the mean time, I would  always ask for clarity before consuming. I appreciate that there are well  labeled controls and plenty of outlets, though no USB C, on both sides of the  bed, but the raised placement is a bit strange- not complaining though, just different. Upon check in there was quite a large piece of  pineapple cake on the central table, though that cloche has certainly seen better days. Then we have the bathroom which is split. In this small area separated by a  sliding door we have a single vanity with plenty of shelving and a decent sized walk in shower. The  toilet area we will see is near the front door. Bathroom amenities included  soaps by Christophe Laudamiel. I did get the feeling this room was meant for a  different guest though as there were children’s toiletries also setup in the bathroom and a  third pair of childrens slippers in the closet. Finally, we have the toilet room with a 2nd sink. The entry closet and toilet  area can also be closed off from the rest of the room by double sliding doors. Finally to the balcony, which was nice to  get some fresh air, but ultimately I think unnecessary. Just a few cleanliness and condition issues in the room. The glass was just filthy, looks like  they attempted to clean it with a dirty towel. Then are are a lot of tiny minor nicks and  scratches which on their own aren’t significant, but when a room has this many dents and  scuffs after just four years of use, I don’t want to think about how  it’ll look five years from now. The worst offender was the floor in the bathroom  which was clearly not meant to get wet, but it completely rotted through and warped. Last up, just lots of dust in quite a few areas above eye level. The cleanliness problems weren’t deal breakers, but the condition especially  of that floor was really poor showing. Before we head to the hall of  restaurants for dinner, let’s just quickly look at who is going to be staying here. Couples in their 20s-40s is the dominant group you’ll find here with a few young families  and perhaps some medical tourists as well. The hotel has its moments of being understated and relaxed but as I’ll talk about later,  also has a slightly pretentious side. Ok, so dinner. If you ever find yourself on  their website trying to figure out what the dining concept is, good luck. Let me tell you what  they say it is, “Ascending the central staircase, guests arrive at JOGAKBO, which means  ‘traditional patchwork’ in Korean, offers a sophisticated reinterpretation of  Seoul’s immersive street and alleyway dining. Three drinking and dining venues  flow seamlessly into adjacent spaces, allowing guest to conveniently explore a  variety of creative, locally inspired cuisine. That is the biggest crock of  s*** if ever I’ve heard one. Let me translate it. It’s one big open  space. Three restaurants in a railway design, walking through one to get to the next. They  mention it’s supposed to be reminiscent of Seoul’s immersive street dining  and locally inspired cuisine. One restaurant is all day dining,  surrounding the staircase, then is the Seafood restaurant and behind  that the steak house. All three restaurants, not a single Korean item on any of the menus.  Some great locally inspired cuisine that is. I saw before I left my room that the room  service menu had a few basic Korean dishes on it and I asked if I would be able to  order from that menu in the restaurant and they graciously accommodated me. There weren’t many choices, I went with a bibimbap and it was very good, but my God, never  has a dining concept ever been such a let down. Anyway, day began to turn to night and I caught  the tail end of the sunset from my balcony. Waking up early the next morning, I identified  with this… duck? And I headed down to The Summer House which is the name of their  wellness facility on the basement level. Down here is an indoor pool and a fitness  center which I wanted to get some quick clips of and ohhh they did not like  that- especially in the pool area. Mind you, we all have eyes, we can  see there was absolutely no one here. Anyway, the LED screen gives it a really strange  dystopian vibe, but hey, some might like it. The fitness center was very well equipped though  and pretty beautiful as far as fitness centers go. Finally our last stop is back to the  canteen, I mean Jogakbo for breakfast, where they do serve up a nice buffet. When creating a hotel or flight review, what do you think are some of the most  important characteristics about those reviews? To me, to make a truly unbiased review, two  things need to be true. First, I need to pay a fare or rate that is publicly available and  receive no special treatment or compensation. Second, I need to film anonymously. So rest  assured that this video today is exactly what I say it is, an unbiased review. And  that is why your likes, comments and subscriptions mean so much, they really do help  the channel to grow and continue to put out this twice weekly and soon three times weekly  content. My patreon is also linked below. These have to be the most perfect  eggs I’ve ever seen. All of it. And finally I found where they’re  hiding all of the Korean food. Though the chopsticks sticking out of  each dish is giving me a bit of angst. Ok, so, overall three things went wrong  here. A totally disjointed food concept, a strange use of the public spaces and  lots of cheap materials in the room. That said, it’s not a bad hotel, but it’s  certainly not a place I’d be returning to. Despite that, I do hope you enjoyed the video.  If you did, please be sure to click that thumbs up button and subscribe with notifications on  so you don’t miss the rest of this 12 country, 21 hotel, 15 flight mega trip.

{"video_id":"fkPg2ONbfjs","lang":"en","full_text":"[Music] thank you hi everyone welcome back to our Channel Kurt ashing adventures and for today\u0027s Vlog we are taking you back to Seoul South Korea it\u0027s been more than three years since we last visited South Korea and then pandemic hits good thing that we are already entering Post pandemic and we were able to travel once again as a family in South Korea for today\u0027s video we are sharing to you our experience and our review to the hotel where we stayed in Seoul it\u0027s called Ibis Ambassador Seoul myeongdong we booked this hotel through an aqua Plus application as mentioned before I am an acroplast member so it\u0027s easier to book the hotel and you will also get a lot of benefits so once you landed in Indian airport you can take either the iris or their Express train going to Seoul station a taxi or the airport bus ambassadors is just two stops from Seoul station so once you arrive at Seoul station just find your way to the line one Subway and then you have to alight at City Hall and transfer to line two and the nearest station or subway station is exit number six [Music] you just have to walk a few meters and when you see the myeongdong underground shopping center exit 19 you will see Ibis Hotel just in the corner unlike other hotels we\u0027re in the reception it\u0027s just in the first floor Ibis hotels reception area is on the 19th floor so you have to take the elevator for you to check in their standard check-in time is at 2 pm and the standard checkout is 12 noon if you arrive earlier than the standard check-in and your room is not available yet you can request to leave your baggage so you can export the city already foreign [Music] rooms available in this hotel but for us we book The Standard room with two single beds that is already good for three persons the room is spacious enough to house our huge luggages it also has a functional work desk LCD TV with cable channels house slippers small fridge and of course the bed is very comfortable to sleep [Music] thank you it has a private toilet and bath with an automatic bidet for the toilet it also has a hair dryer they do not provide Dental kits and other toiletries inside the bathroom instead if you need one you can request it to the reception area [Music] the hotel has a lot of amenities it has a very cool cafe and restaurant overlooking the Namsan Tower [Music] if you are an exercise Enthusiast they have a gym that you can use for free [Music] what we love so much about this hotel is the hot pot so after retiring day you can soak yourself in the hot bath to ease all the muscle pains all you have to do is to make sure that you book in advance on what time you want to use the hot pot when you are using the Hot Pot you don\u0027t need to bring anything because everything is provided in the facility so they have private lockers for your sleepers and for your personal items they also have towels and toiletries that you can use they also have a comb here but you don\u0027t need to worry in using it because it is always sanitized because it is housed in a UV light machine the temperature in the hot pot is 42 degrees Celsius [Music] foreign amenities in this hotel is the coin laundry because if you are traveling to South Korea during the winter season definitely you\u0027ll be bringing a lot of baggages of your clothes if you don\u0027t want to carry a lot of packages your only option is to do the laundry during your vacation you don\u0027t need to bring the churches because you can buy the detergent inside the coin laundry which only cost 1 000 won and for the machine wash that\u0027s that will cost 5 000 won and for the dryer that\u0027s also 5001 they also have the ironing facility in this area and the microwave ovens [Music] our hotel booking comes with a free breakfast and dances served from 7am until 10 30 in the morning this is served in the restaurant in the 19th floor there are only few choices for the breakfast they have breads rice fruits and vegetables and also coffee machines are available to make [Music] thank you the location of this hotel is very ideal for the tourists because it\u0027s in the center of myeongdong so just outside your hotel you can already see different foods that comes to life at 4 30 in the afternoon until late night there\u0027s a lot of shopping centers here for your cosmetic needs and other items for shopping everything is also walking distance from this hotel if you want to visit Namsan Tower is also walking distance and different plotted department stores aside from that there are a lot of restaurants bars and cafes within this location the hotel is also close by the subway station and also one of the pickup points of the airport bus trackout is also very seamless in this hotel because they have available reception 24x7 so you don\u0027t need to worry if you are living very early in the morning you can also leave your baggages in this hotel if you are traveling to other cities of South Korea just like for us we travel to Busan for another two days and we just left our baggages in this hotel [Music] overall we had an amazing stay at Evis Ambassador Seoul myongo we highly recommend this hotel when you are also traveling to Seoul South Korea we love this hotel because of its location facilities and amenities as well as the staffs who are very friendly and they are also English speaking so that sums up our stay in Evis Ambassador Seoul myeongdong so if you like this video guys don\u0027t forget to hit that

has recently become one of the more popular destinations in Asia since many flights coming from the Philippines are Redeye flights or those that arrive in the Wii hours of the morning we will be featuring one of the hotel options near inchon International Airport the Best Western Premiere inchon let\u0027s explore and check out if this is an Ideal Hotel to Kickstart or end your trip to Soul by the way if it\u0027s your first time in the Channel please don\u0027t forget to like subscribe and tap the the notification Bell icon to receive updates every time we have a new travel video so we are now inside the lobby of the hotel for Round the Clock convenience there is a CU store at the farther end of the lobby then you will notice a lot of sitting areas suitable for guests waiting for their flights there\u0027s also a fully equipped Business Center on the left side to help with secretarial translation photocopying and Courier Services on the right side is the hotel\u0027s front desk and conge counters probably unique among airport hotels like this is the luggage weighing scale available at the lobby this allows guests to check if they exceed their allowances before proceeding to the airport Best Western Premier Enon is located within the International Business Center it is part of the hotel and resort complex that aims to transform Inon into a thriving airport city and tourism Hub we\u0027ve just completed checkin it was Swift and easy but lacked human touch the process with the front desk felt like interacting with a machine as there was no smile warmth and life for this overnight stay we booked the deluxe twin room T let\u0027s check it out this is the deluxe twin room it is 32 square m in size andlike many hotels we\u0027ve been to this room is mainly meant to be functional and does not have the added aesthetic quality such as breathtaking views unique architecture and stylish Furnishings the amenities include a closet a tea and coffee counter a luggage rack two beds an electronic safe a landline phone a cable TV an alarm clock addressing slw workking desk room service menu charging outlets and a sitting area the room is usually priced at 32,000 Korean one per night but we were able to get it for just 10 4,982 Korean 1 via Agoda this rate included overnight accommodation free Wi-Fi access and free Airport chutle bus service as expected of an airport hotel the room lacked personality with little imagination to Interior Design you can just find a single wall painting that looks like a blue hibiscus a variety of Korea\u0027s national flower Best Western should throw away decade old expectations of airport hotels out the window they should reconceptualize and Infuse functionality with Sleek or stylish design they can also add more Leisure facilities like a pool and a spa to change this typical view of a parking lot the toilet though is well appointed it has a bathtub with a shower and an electric toilet with today and heated seat note that under new environmental loss in Korea hotels are no longer allowed to provide single-use toiletries such as toothbrush toothpaste and shampoo so make sure to bring your own outside the room Best Western Premier Inon is not at all boring with its additional services and Facilities the first of which is the fitness center it is located at the second level and open daily from 6:00 in the morning to 10: in the evening equipment include chest fly treadmills eliptical stationary bike flat cool down leg press functional trainer adjustable bench and various weights so even if you are just having a quick stop in this hotel you can still work up a sweat and keep your Fitness routine on track for golf enthusiasts the hotel also offers an indoor golf range this unique facility somehow sets Best Western Premier inch on Art you can hone your puttting skills on the golf green practice your swing or simply play a round or two with family and friends best of all access to this is completely free for hotel guests unlike in usual hotels where there is laundry service in Best Western Premier Inon there is a coin laundry this is a self-service facility where guests can wash and dry clothes using coin operated washing machine and Tumble dryer whether you\u0027re on a business trip or in a leisurely vacation you can keep your wardrobe fresh and CLE C without any hassle this facility is open daily from 6:00 in the morning until 10: in the evening lastly the hotel offers complimentary bus Transfer Facility to ensure a WorryFree arrival and departure for guests this service is available on half hour intervals between 6:00 in the morning to 1110 in the evening the pickup from the airport for the shuttle is at Terminal 1 arrival Hall F Exit 14 so can we say that Best Western Premier Inon is an ideal airport hotel for this day you are giving it a score of 7.57 it has all the facilities of an airport hotel but service and Personal Touch must improve the hotel can also aim to do a facelift to make it more of a destination than just a stop over so thank you so much for watching and see you in our next video as we explore the world one trip

Here’s where the breakfast tickets and rental info makes sense: The hotel charges around ₩65,000 for adult breakfast if not included in a package Also, the listed facilities fee typically covers access to the sauna—but not everything—so it\u0027s good to know what counts as extra we got upgraded our room is 1748 so it\u0027s pretty high I think and it\u0027s a wooden card too in elevator hand sanitizer this is the Nam San tower what a close view this is where we just came 1748 the left side is a mountain and the right side is the Hangang River view open that\u0027s very nice they have a  built in water water system Here I am walking into the 1 King Bed room—this is exactly the type of room that guests consistently praise around 323 sq ft, with soundproofing, blackout drapes, a refrigerator, LED TV, premium bedding, down comforters, and even rollaway bed options if you need them These rooms often come in “Mountain View” or “River View” variants; both score nearly 9–10/10 guest ratings for comfort and visuals The space feels modern and efficient. Tablet, minibar, safe, bathrobes,  slippers—you name it, it’s there. The bathroom might feel snug, but it’s clean and functional with enough counter space, designer toiletries, and in some room types, a tub or a shower so this is the coffee and tea the tea is by osulloc! Coca Cola Zero is 8,000WON and this is the fridge and the cup since there is water here there\u0027s no water bottle so you gotta drink it by glass there\u0027s no plastic so this is a mirror inside the bathroom and this is by Balmain as well should we do a shower check strong strong there was a lock inside the thing safety box beside the bed and if you put press this it goes to shade I think some privacy this is a window as well amenities are all by balmain soap and body lotion and these are the dental kit sanitary bag shower cap cotton buds cotton pads dental kit and also comb that so the room looks like this this 1 king size bed room with breakfast was 275,723won which is not bad in my opinion. it\u0027s quite nice and this is the view there\u0027s a ice rink and there\u0027s also tennis From our floor-to-ceiling windows, you get panoramic glimpses of Seoul’s cityscape—with Namsan Tower and the Han River like bonus postcards. the breakfast is from 6:30 to 10:00am and on the weekends and holidays until 10:00am and it\u0027s a breakfast buffet and the indoor swimming pool is from 6:30 to 10PM and also the gym is 24 hours and the sauna is with fee which is 63,000WON it\u0027s quite expensive just for the sauna the ice rink is open until 9 PM so let\u0027s go this is the view we\u0027re going here we are going here right now we did a takeout of pizza our favorite pizza place it\u0027s called pizzeria di Buzza very good very ymy so we\u0027re gonna eat this and go explore the hotel smells spicy also eating bulgogi cheese the ice machine it was beside the elevator this is the GL floor there\u0027s like a little shop here and this is barbor and also a pilates! and there\u0027s also tippang restaurants and that\u0027s the workout class that they\u0027re doing so we\u0027re at the lobby floor and there\u0027s like a wine shop I don\u0027t think it\u0027s not that expensive too so this is where they have the breakfast buffet which is which we are going tomorrow morning so this is the lobby this is different lounge I think I feel like they sell afternoon tea or something they have live music in the evening maybe I might want to go here cause they have live music like you know there\u0027s a piano over there what a view Adjacent, the wellness area includes saunas, steam rooms, and indoor pools. In summer, there’s an outdoor pool; in winter, c it transforms into a charming seasonal ice rink with skate rentals available—another signature amenity that families love!! what..... the ticket we got was to just go in lol and if you wanna skate there\u0027s gonna be another fee here\u0027s the ice rink let\u0027s go get hot chocolate or something so we\u0027re going in here to get hot chocolate ramen?? what the hell ramen is 58000WON LOLLL and but they have lobster and scallops and prawns what the hell I wanna I might wanna try that so we just got this Oden and signature hot chocolate fish cake soup smells so good very pretty it\u0027s almost sunset I think guess how much this was guys I feel like it\u0027s not as expensive as it this is  this is $10 I mean it\u0027s New York prices OK expensive  in won well let\u0027s try it looks good though smells good so good I wanna try the soup first this is a signature there\u0027s also cinnamon but signature has marshmallow and the cinnamon one has dark chocolate inside hmm that\u0027s a bit on the sweeter side not complaining it\u0027s really good they have rice cakes too I know we just had ramen but more like a Japanese Oden what the hell thats so good who would of thought we will be eating this lol so I\u0027m just walking to the convenience store and there\u0027s C U and GS25 right over there I thought I had to go down the hill or something but good thing that there\u0027s a convenience store nearby sunset is on the Namsan Tower  side so if you wanna see the sunset I recommend booking the namsan Tower side not the Riverside but that means sunrise gonna be on that side so  I\u0027m excited for the sunrise ice rink was kind of disappointed because I thought that the guest can use it for free but the price was originally 55,001 but if you\u0027re a guest there\u0027s gonna be 30% off which means it\u0027s gonna be like 35,000 which is still kind of expensive but  it was too cold for us so we didn\u0027t do it we\u0027re gonna go back and  go to the gym and go eat dinner or something it\u0027s the c onvenience store it\u0027s not that far it\u0027s only like five minutes away this is what the lobby looks like now at night it\u0027s so pretty all the trees became lights I don\u0027t know if you guys can see but the moon is crazy it is about 7:30 she\u0027s having a spa session right now it\u0027s the Nelson Tower and I\u0027m gonna go to the gym when we were going to the ice rink I saw a bit of the gym it was packed so I realized that there was a uh Olympus Spa Spa Club which is for not only guest which is like normal gym so I hope there\u0027s not many people at the gym since it\u0027s late it\u0027s quite spacious so I\u0027m excited The gym is decked out—free weights, cardio gear, and LifeFitness machines. Guests say it’s larger than most hotel gyms, with top-notch equipment, though it can get lively during peak hours this is also a room for personal training so this is what the shop is they sell non fiction which is a Korean brand and their own accessories and stuff the brand is called Halo Hello I am down at the GL floor because I am getting a spa massage I\u0027m getting a massage at the spa do the one I\u0027m getting a massage at the spa it was a surprise I\u0027m getting it I\u0027m so excited Now, let’s slide into something quieter, something that whispers tranquility: The Spa, nestled on the garden level, designed for inner calm. Opened in 2007 and refined since, the spa is a full sensory step-away from city noise. Architect John Morford designed 14 private treatment rooms, including standalone spa suites with private showers and grooming areas, plus Vichy treatment rooms fitted with remote-controlled showers, and even a couple’s suite for shared relaxation This is where East meets West: The menu weaves traditional Korean techniques—like ginseng Meridian Massage—with modern aromatherapy and body scrubs. You can choose from modalities like Balance, Energise, Nourish, or Calm, each offering 60–90 minute sessions. For those looking for a deep reset, there are extended cycles that stretch up to four hours with carefully choreographed rituals More recent descriptions affirm it’s a serene getaway within the hotel: guests enjoy relaxing massages, rejuvenating facials, aroma-stone treatments, and foot massages, layered with uniquely Korean elements like six-year-old ginseng, herbal blends, and calming botanicals roibos and herb and one more tea but I totally forgot what the other one was but I\u0027m going to drink this and then get changed so the tea that I got is hibiscus tea and it tastes so nice and this here is dried ginger dried ginger like jelly it\u0027s very crunchy sudden asmr sesh hmm that\u0027s really good going to enjoy this and then meet my hubby bye this is how the room looks like it\u0027s so nice The spa staff complement the ambiance—attentive, safety-conscious (masks included, post-pandemic), and tailored to your needs, whether you want a quick express treatment or a full spa-day escape There’s no shortage of food and drink options: The Terrace (buffet), Teppan, Kauri (sushi), The Steak House, Tenaki, Paris Bar (perfect for evening vibes), The Deli, and room service 24/7 how was the massage so nice so nice I have reincarnated to a new body these are all the restaurants here the teppanyaki is really nice just had a gym session it was very nice too really how was your gym session very nice it\u0027s a full moon today really i did a little suprise for her but... ends at 10 says nine let\u0027s go the present  thanks we both brought something for each other I\u0027m so sensitive I\u0027m so sensitive what what this is what the pool looks like it is almost 9:00 so this is the jacuzzi  so warm very nice this is open till 10 so we\u0027re gonna relax and I\u0027m we\u0027re gonna do take out or maybe delivery to the hotel cause it\u0027s Korea so we see you guys in the room we got the goods if you order you have to get it at the lobby because they can\u0027t go upstairs that\u0027s a live so this is what we ordered we ordered from this branch a chicken brand called Peticana Peticana it smells so good it came with fries which we were craving very nice so today\u0027s Valentine so we\u0027re gonna eat a lot this is a Grand Hyatt chocolate it is from the deli that we went this afternoon the chocolates are very cute we already had two and these are the normal chocolates the packaging is pretty interesting hmm you love this mm hmm I love this this is your kind of Yangnyeom this is not your kind of Yangnyeom？？ it is good morning it is about 8:28 we gotta go to the breakfast buffet yes we said we were gonna go at 8 but we literally overslept for like the last 20 minutes so we\u0027re getting our way now there\u0027s a line to the breakfast we came back because they don\u0027t accept slippers now let’s goo tobreakfast because it’s not just morning food, it’s a whole experience here. You walk into The Terrace, an airy, restaurant-sized space right across from the lobby. Imagine seven live buffet stations, each offering something freshly made to order—eggs, breads, even mini pancakes and waffles The first thing guests point out? The view. Opt for a window seat early in the morning, especially before 8 a.m.—it’s quieter, more peaceful, and you’re gifted a front-row panorama of Seoul that turns eating into a vibe Many visitors say they’d happily come just for that calm, early-morning atmosphere. As for the food, reviews are fair but positive. You get the essentials: freshly baked breads, pastries, charcuterie boards, a cereal and fresh juice section A standout feature is the made-to-order egg station—the omelets are fluffy, personalized, and paired with attentive, friendly chefs On the Korean side, the offerings are more modest than at some other luxury hotels—so there’s a noodle station, rice porridge, and a few traditional dishes—but it’s not the star focus. Still, some guests highlight the standout items like ginseng chicken congee and abalone congee as unexpectedly excellent The Terrace isn\u0027t Michelin-level breakfast, but it offers dependable quality, a warm selection of East-meets-West favorites, and most importantly—those unbeatable tree-top views this is beef bulgogi and this is the fruit section they have dragon fruits never had a dragon fruit in and that\u0027s the fall ham sausage bacon orange juice my first plate very creamy let me try the bamboo rice how do I even eat this bamboo rice this is no bamboo rice you gotta try this very sweet *banana pudding I wonder if this is real gold no how do you like it so we just checked out and we\u0027re heading to DDP cause we gotta film something else too how was the stay?? it was so nice that we were actually considering to extend our stay but I know we just didn\u0027t but  that\u0027s how good it was the hospitality was great the service was great the food was great the gym was great I highly recommend it it\u0027s like a bit like the accessibility wise like it\u0027s kind of difficult because it\u0027s like way up the hill but except for that I feel like everything was great highly recommend kind of has like a like like a resort vibe because it\u0027s kind of like on top of the hill and it\u0027s in the Hanam area so very bougie like calm and like quiet locations this spot is definitely for you I hope you guys like today\u0027s video see you guys in the next one thank you husband for sponsoring this trip bye bye and the breakfast was top notch very good Service here gets high marks consistently. Guests say the staff are “authentically smiley” and responsivec So what did our 1 King Bed Members Save More + Breakfast stay really give us?c A roomy, cozy sanctuary with luxe bedding and calm views; a solid buffet breakfast across cultures; robust fitness and wellness amenities; and warm, efficient service, all tucked into a tranquil hillside setting, yet easy to access restaurants and the city below."}

{"video_id":"-2p-7NelQFA","lang":"en","full_text":"This hotel is pretty, but it feels strangely a bit excessive. It is said to be decorated with the motif of the Verepoque period in 19th century Paris, France, but the concept is so extreme that opinions are extremely divided. Let\u0027s find out together how Another Leaving Man felt. [Music] Hello, I am Another Leaving Man. The 4-star boutique hotel SKE that I will introduce today is located at Exit 7 of Hoewon Station, which has a strange atmosphere where the traditional market Namdaemun Market and the high-end department store Shinsegae Department Store coexist. SK2 is the first brand that was independently launched in 2018 by Shinsegae Chosun Hotel without the help of a foreign hotel chain. It is said that Vice Chairman Chung Yong-jin of Shinsegae Group shared it in particular. The hotel was built with the concept of the Verepoque period of the 19th century, one of the most splendid periods in France, as a boutique hotel with 204 rooms. Even the design was designed by Jacques Garcia, who received the Légendonné, and the name of the hotel was built with the meaning of escape in mind. However,  The hotel\u0027s first impression is that it \u0027s located in an oddly-shaped office building, making you wonder if it\u0027s a hotel. You can barely tell it\u0027s a hotel by the entrance. However, from the first-floor entrance, you can feel the authenticity of a French boutique hotel. The black-and-white checkered floor, wine-colored furniture, and even the mirrored wall in front, decorated like a real pink muhly, give it the feel of a well-decorated cafe. The elevators, which appear around the corner, have similar yet different patterns, black-and-white floors, dreamy lighting, and even vintage mirrors, continuing the hotel\u0027s unique concept. There\u0027s a desk, but actual check-in is done at the 7th-floor front desk. Even the elevator to the 7th floor has a very French feel, with announcements coming in both Korean and English. The 7th-floor hallway is adorned with bright pink flower arrangements. To the left and right of the front desk are check-in desks. Initially, only the space on the right was used as the front desk, while the space on the left was occupied by a cafe called Hell Cafe. However, perhaps because the front desk was too small for the size of the guest rooms, both spaces are now occupied.  It\u0027s being used as a front desk. I had a strong impression of the first-floor entrance, but the front desk on the 7th floor felt even more impressive. The red walls look even more intense through the contrast of the large floral carpet and the black wainscoting. The furniture and various paintings that don\u0027t look ordinary at all are amazing. It\u0027s surprising that there is such a unique place in Seoul that feels like you\u0027ve simultaneously traveled through time and space. L\u0027 Escape Hotel has four types of regular rooms and five types of suites. The rooms I\u0027m going to show you today are the Atelier Suite, the most basic of the suites, and the Secret Room, a mid-level regular room. Before I get into the details of the rooms, I\u0027d like to share a tip that travelers should definitely know. These days, we use smartphones and the internet almost all the time, not only when traveling but also in everyday life. In particular, I worried a lot about my financial information or personal information being exposed when I used a credit card or logged into social media that contained personal information for online banking while traveling. That\u0027s why I started using a VPN. When using public Wi-Fi, such as at an airport or hotel, anyone connected to the same Wi-Fi only needs basic computer knowledge.  They say that even with a VPN, you can steal personal information like credit card information or passwords. That\u0027s why the VPN I trust and use is Express VPN, which I\u0027m introducing today. It\u0027s an app that 100% encrypts your network data and uses the highest-level encryption, making it unbreakable even by hackers with supercomputers. It\u0027s incredibly simple to use, with just one button press. You can also change your online location, allowing you to watch thousands of movies and dramas on Netflix, which offers different content by country. For example, if you connect to Turkey, you can watch Harry Potter, or if you connect to India, you can watch Blade Season 2. You can also watch domestic sports matches on JTBC or SPOTV, which are not available overseas while traveling. If you sign up using the special link \"Tteotnam\" in the \"More Videos\" section and the pinned comment, you\u0027ll also receive a three-month free benefit. Go right now and protect your personal information. Now, let\u0027s go back to SK Port and take a look at the taxis. The first room you\u0027ll see is the basic suite or the Atelier Suite. The interior of the room is truly red. Red fills the eyes from every direction. It \u0027s a sweet room, but the space is n\u0027t separated. The sofa and bedroom are open like a studio. The intense red color.  The velvet furniture and floor were gorgeous, but what really made the room extra dazzling was the silk-embroidered wallpaper. I initially wondered if it was a fake, but up close, it was quite elaborate and detailed. In front, there\u0027s an antique-style sofa and table, comfortably seating five people, making it perfect for a party with friends. Western paintings lining the walls reinforce the French Versailles feel, and the unified design of the lamps and lighting complements the ambiance. The bed, too, has an impressive, ornate ruffled headboard, reminiscent of a French palace. It\u0027s strikingly similar to the bed I saw in a suite at the Four Seasons Hotel in Prague, Czech Republic, not long ago. My friend\u0027s room is unusual, with a geometric design, and the matrix is ​​an Ace Hertz premium product. Beside the bed is a small round table and chair. On the nightstand is a Giga Genie, along with a room controller for controlling the lights and curtains. Even the button design matches the tone of the room. Two TVs are installed so that viewers can watch TV from both the bed and the sofa, and a work table is placed in the middle. The bathroom, located next to the bed, continues the black-and-white flooring I saw in the lobby. If only the bedroom had been a single shade of red, it would have been even more impressive.  The bathroom has impressive yellow walls and lighting. Wayne coasting decoration extends from the guest room to the bathroom, creating a unique atmosphere. The gold-tone faucet and stand lamp go well together, and even the bathroom, with its white sink and bathtub, is no joke for its Instagram-worthy vibe. However, what is the purpose of the chair next to the bathtub? I thought it was a bit inappropriate to have velvet furniture in front of the splashing bathtub, but it looks good in terms of design. The amenities are from a Spanish cosmetic brand, and the products are packaged in reusable containers. The toothpaste is uniquely provided in tablet form, so you have to chew it to create foam. I thought there would be a Dyson hairdryer because it\u0027s a suite, but it\u0027s not a Bison, it\u0027s a Deinova. The minibar next to the sofa contains a Nespresso coffee machine and Virtua capsules. Looking around up to this point, I thought it wasn\u0027t as bad as I thought, but somehow the room felt a bit stuffy. The reason was that the view from the room window was close enough to the building in front that you could see it from across the street. If you turn around, you can see Namsan Tower or Seoul Station, but the view is disappointing. But more importantly, the night view.  When you close the curtains, the red velvet makes the room really gloomy. It looks like a secret meeting is about to take place. If it were a cafe, I could just have a cup of coffee and leave, but since it\u0027s a hotel where you have to stay for one or two days, you have to endure the darkness and gloomy atmosphere for hours, and it feels a bit distracting. This shortcoming is especially noticeable in the regular rooms, which are even smaller and have less lighting. The chic guest room you\u0027re looking at now has walls decorated in red that matches the carpet instead of embroidered wallpaper. They seemed to think that red furniture would be too crazy, so they used gray and blue tones to tone it down. Unlike the Atelier Suite bathroom, which had a yellow feel, even the walls are decorated in red, and there\u0027s only one sink. It\u0027s definitely smaller than the Atelier Suite, and the lack of lighting makes the dark and gloomy shortcomings feel much more noticeable. If you ca n\u0027t find comfortable healing in your room, you should go outside. However, SKE, a boutique hotel of the highest class, doesn\u0027t have a swimming pool. The fitness center is available by reservation only, and even the fitness center is really...  It\u0027s nicely decorated. It feels more like a well-decorated fitness shop than a gym, but it\u0027s not as easy to make a reservation as you might think. Main dishes are served at the Chinese restaurant Palais de Chine on the 6th floor. Even if you\u0027re not staying at L\u0027Escape, I\u0027ve often visited here before because of the great food and atmosphere. The breakfast is a Chinese a la carte menu, with a choice of tomato soup noodles or fried rice. In addition to the return menu, bread and cereal are also available in a complimentary format. As you eat, your a la carte menu will be served. I ordered tomato soup noodles, and it was a generous meal with scrambled eggs, sausage toast, and salad. At first, I thought it was a waste to pay 33,000 won, but since I was eating a la carte at the hotel\u0027s Chinese restaurant, I thought it wasn\u0027t too bad. Suite guests can also enjoy the Savril Lounge at the Marc Davor on the 26th floor on the evening of their check-in date. Marc Davor also has a dark atmosphere that matches the overall atmosphere of the hotel, but it\u0027s okay if it\u0027s dark quickly. They offer two glasses of champagne, a cocktail, and a simple meal with scones, sausage bread, and more.  While you\u0027re there, they provide food that\u0027s good enough to have a drink. The atmosphere was great, the food was good, and everything was great, but it was a bit disappointing that you could only use it for an hour and then leave. In addition, La Mansikre, led by Chef Son Jong-won, is also located on the 26th floor, the same floor as the check-in counter. There\u0027s a Starbucks Reserve store on the 7th floor, where the check-in counter was located. If you feel like spending money on stock, you can buy coffee and a muffin to enjoy. In addition, there\u0027s a library that was only accessible to suite guests. It\u0027s decorated so stylishly and beautifully that it reminds me of the library in Harry Potter. Thanks to the French concept, the piano is a Flair product. Since tea or desserts aren\u0027t provided, you can just sit there. But if you have something to do while you\u0027re at the hotel, would n\u0027t it be better to come down to the library rather than stay in a stuffy room? Then, what would be your overall review of L\u0027Escape? It \u0027s a hotel that puts a lot of thought into details, but it\u0027s a shame that it\u0027s so faithful to its concept that it loses the essence of the hotel and fails to be objective. If you go to a place in Korea that pursues a European atmosphere, it\u0027s usually a bit...  I often feel that it is crude and sloppy. I thought L\u0027Escape would be quite shabby because it pursues the French Bédépoque style, but it\u0027s better than I thought. You can see that they really put a lot of effort into even the smallest details, to the point where you wonder if they really care about these things. From the antique furniture to the strong, bold color expressions, I think this kind of attempt should be applauded. However, the problem is that they missed the functional essence of a hotel. The strong red color is certainly impressive, but it doesn\u0027t fit with a staycation to escape from everyday life and heal. If the rooms had been a little brighter and more vibrant, even though they are in the same French Bédépoque style, I think they would have been loved by many more people. Nevertheless, I think that a hotel with a unique character like L\u0027Escape should be welcomed because it broadens the range of choices for consumers who enjoy staycations. So, I have no major complaints about the hotel\u0027s concept and interior facilities. However, the reason L\u0027Escape lost popularity from the beginning of its opening is because it set the price too high compared to the size of a hotel. It is a 4-star boutique hotel without a swimming pool, and the suites account for 100% of the total rooms.  The 40% discount was questionable, and the initial price was exorbitant. Unfortunately, the hotel\u0027s reputation suffered early on, when word of mouth should have spread. There were also numerous issues, both large and small, such as fire code violations and the placement and subsequent removal of adult products in guest rooms. However, perhaps it\u0027s achieved its own success, and the prices have since dropped to a more reasonable level. I booked a special price and used coupons, but with a basic room costing around 100,000 won and an Atelier Suite around 200,000 won, I \u0027d happily pay that much. I would n\u0027t stay there as a family, and while I don\u0027t have children, I certainly wouldn\u0027t bring them. Instead, I think it\u0027d be a great place for a couple who\u0027s drifted apart to rekindle a relationship, or for a group of friends to have a party. Staying more than one night would be a bit of a stretch. If today\u0027s video was helpful to you, please subscribe, like, and turn on notifications. Next time, I\u0027ll be back with a review of two new hotels in Bangkok that are popular with Koreans these days. So, I\u0027ve been a man who\u0027s left again, and I\u0027ve been leaving again.

{"video_id":"nA5DE3rpYL4","lang":"en","full_text":"There is a hotel in which guests can see Korea\u0027s number one treasure through the windows. This is a key luxury brand in the Marriott Group the JW Marriott Dongdaemun Square Seoul. Join me in touring all rooms the pretty swimming pool and fitness center. What\u0027s up guys! I\u0027m DDN. Dongdaemun Shopping Complex is the mecca of wholesale fashion in Korea. It may be weird for a luxury hotel to be in this area but this is where today\u0027s hotel JW Marriott Dongdaemun Square Seoul, is. This is the second JW Marriott hotel in Seoul. The hotel is located where Dongdaemun Bus Terminal was. The terminal once gathered wholesale retail sellers from all over the country and the 11-story hotel is located there with a total of 170 rooms. As can be seen through its name the hotel faces Heunginjimun, also known as Dongdaemun which is the number one treasure of our nation. The hotel is thus special for its rare view. Shall we check in now? The hotel lobby, which is decorated with marble floors and walls is quite small for a JW Marriott hotel. The hotel itself isn\u0027t large in scale so the check-in desk and waiting area aren\u0027t big either. But the winding staircase and fancy chandelier make the simple lobby space look better. As the hotel\u0027s name has \u0027Dongdaemun\u0027 in it the hallways and doors are decorated in a Korean style. From the two types of basic rooms and three types of suites let\u0027s start with the most basic, Deluxe room. The first thing that caught my eye was Dongdaemun itself. As a person living in Seoul, I\u0027ve been past Dongdaemun Station a lot and could see Dongdaemun here and there often but seeing it from a hotel room made it more special. Not all Deluxe rooms have a Dongdaemun view. One has to book a room with a Dongdaemun view to be able to see it. From the rooms in which Dongdaemun can be seen there are rooms with windows that only take up a part of the wall and rooms with windows as walls so to view Dongdaemun more beautifully booking the latter type would be a better idea. The room itself contained characteristics that showed JW Marriott Dongdaemun\u0027s characteristics well. Through the red carpet and furniture the room seemed more original and unlike other cliche hotel rooms. The elegant colors and Dongdaemun, visible through the window brought the Korean ambience together. The beds, which have Simmons\u0027 beauty rest mattresses also provide a roomy and comfortable sleeping space. The wall facing the bed is made of a different type of wood compared to the floor and gives the room a more traditional look. The box instead of a mini bar and a shelf with cups and wine glasses are also creative. There are also capsule coffee machines and JW Marriott Dongdaemun\u0027s own tea bags available. Towards the window, there is a very big table for work making the room great for guests on business trips and for those who want to enjoy the view from the chair. The bedroom has two entrances one from the door and one from the bed. It can be seen through a sliding door giving the room a wide, open feel. This room is not a suite but the fact that there is a small television next to the sink is also great. Behind the sink, there is a bathtub and towards the front, there is a shower booth and toilet. The shower booth has a nice sitting space and handle making it comfortable to use for those with discomfort in mobility as well. The amenities are from AROMATHERAPY Associates, an English brand and it\u0027s nice that there are hair straighteners along with hair dryers. Other than the Deluxe Room, another type of Basic room is the special Sky View Room. The room itself is similar in composition to the Deluxe Room but it is located at the top floor of the hotel and even the ceilings are windows so it feels a lot more open. From rooms near Dongdaemun to rooms towards the north side, where the Fortress Wall of Seoul is all of the 11th floor provides Sky View Rooms. Because they\u0027re on high floors and are a lot more open they are priced much higher than the other basic rooms. In terms of suites, if we exclude the unbelievable Presidential Suite there are two other types. Let\u0027s start with the Executive Suite. The Executive Suite is the room closest to Dongdaemun in the entire hotel. It basically directly faces Dongdaemun. It\u0027s in the corner, where the Fortress Wall of Seoul can be seen which brings out the ambience even more. But the living room is a bit narrow so it\u0027s not as roomy as one would expect a suite to be. On the other hand, the bedroom is just like the basic Deluxe room. I place a lot of importance on what can be seen when lying down on the bed and from the Executive Suite Dongdaemun can be seen directly. It\u0027s an amazing vibe. The bathroom is also similar to those of the basic rooms but there is a separate dressing room at the end of the hallway making it good to store luggage. Moving on to the big Deluxe Suite which is much bigger than the Executive Suite. We had booked the Executive Suite this day and were lucky enough to get an upgrade to the Deluxe Suite. I was so surprised when I saw the room. The living room was really big. It was big enough to host a party in and the back windows were as long as the walls, making the room look even bigger. But the Deluxe Suite is located in the south corner of the hotel which makes it a bit distant from Dongdaemun so if you want a room with a Dongdaemun view it\u0027d be much better to get a Deluxe room or the Executive Suite room. Since the hotel itself doesn\u0027t have a lot of stories, and the walls are full-on glass windows knowing that one can be seen from the outside when the curtains are drawn may get on one\u0027s mind as well. The bedroom is located in the corner. Usually, the good thing about corner rooms is their view but the south corner was facing the Dongdaemun Market so that wasn\u0027t exactly a plus. But it was nice to see how there were various areas around the Suite to just sit and stare into the city. The Deluxe Suite\u0027s bathroom is very long horizontally. There is a shower space and bathtub on one end and a toilet and small sink on the other end. In the middle, there\u0027s a main sink, closet and a place to store luggage. It is a bit disappointing that there\u0027s just one sink. There is also a separate workspace towards the door. This isn\u0027t that well-known but one of the many strengths of JW Marriott Dongdaemun is its beautiful swimming pool. I can\u0027t say the pool is useful for lap swimming but the deep blue floor tiles and LED lights along with the chandeliers on top and mirrors on the side walls make guests feel like they\u0027re in some European palace. Overall, the hotel has an Asian vibe but the swimming pool exerted more of a romantic, Western ambience. I don\u0027t know about anything else, but the pictures here would look amazing. The fitness center also looked great. Because of the tall ceiling I didn\u0027t even notice that it didn\u0027t have windows. That\u0027s how roomy it is to exercise there. It is filled with machines useful for daily fitness. There is an additional fee, but there is a screen golf center as well. The swimming pool and fitness center are top-class compared to any other hotel in Seoul. The breakfast buffet is at Tavolo 24, at the second floor. Dongdaemun is seen best from this location so the vibe the location has is great and the Korean food it serves is also eye-opening. There are a lot of types of tasty food that make it just as good as Seoul\u0027s top three buffets and it doesn\u0027t go too overboard so I was personally very happy with the breakfast there. Because the hotel itself provides lots of rooms with the option to use the Executive Lounge I imagine a lot of guests will use the club lounge at the 10th floor. The lounge isn\u0027t next-level amazing but it isn\u0027t that bad either. I don\u0027t think there is enough hot food to eat dinner there during Happy Hour but having snacks here and there will make you full. I wouldn\u0027t call it a gourmet restaurant but people can fill their stomachs here. The breakfast here is quite simple, which is characteristic of a lounge buffet but the view that can be seen from the outdoor area is beautiful, so I do recommend it. It\u0027d be nice to visit once during your stay. Other than that, there\u0027s BLT Steakhouse which sells Korean-style steak The Lounge, which is famous for its strawberry buffet and afternoon tea The Griffin, a rooftop bar great to enjoy a drink with the Dongdaemun view Seoul Baking Company the bakery in the basement, and more. There are various food and beverage areas available for use. What is DDN\u0027s overall review of JW Marriott Dongdaemun? I\u0027d say it was nice that it was near Dongdaemun but also had its downsides too. This hotel\u0027s biggest strength is that guests can view our number one national treasure up close. That\u0027s why the hotel\u0027s name has Dongdaemun in it and it is evident that the interior design was inspired by Dongdaemun as well. But because this is an old city center it\u0027s quite outdated, and there\u0027s not much to see so the fact that the hotel is located here makes it a bit weird to go there for a hocance if I may be very honest. The rooms that show Dongdaemun Market are comparatively much less satisfactory than the standards one would expect from a five-star hotel or a JW Marriott. A lot of people who go on \u0027hocance\u0027 trips visit nearby shopping malls or restaurants too but Dongdaemun isn\u0027t that kind of place, which was a bit sad. But if we focus on the hotel itself the rooms are elegant, the facilities are amazing the food is satisfactory and the lounge isn\u0027t bad either so for those of you who like to go on \u0027hocance\u0027 vacations it\u0027d be nice to go here sometime. This is just my personal opinion but compared to JW Marriott Seoul which is too old and only has nice food and beverage options I think JW Marriott Dongdaemun Square is much better. Speaking of JW Marriott I\u0027m sure a lot of you are curious about JW Marriott Jeju as well. I booked a room and am waiting to go there so please wait just a little bit.

{"video_id":"SZ73ebhaXfU","lang":"en","full_text":"Most of you watching this video must have been surprised to find a hotel like this in Seoul. Honestly, I have to admit that the swimming pool is beautiful, and the rooms are duplex-style, offering a wide open view. Finally, a domestic hotel brand has entered Gangnam, Seoul. I will tell you in detail about it. [Music] Hello, I am a man who leaves again. Looking at hotels in Korea, most of them are famous overseas chain hotels or operated by major corporations. However, there is one that is greatly loved, neither an overseas brand nor a domestic corporation. It is Ananti. Ananti 4 is a company that develops premium golf courses and resorts centered on membership. They already operate excellent resorts and golf courses in Gijang and Namui, Busan, and Gapyeong, Gyeonggi-do. However, it was difficult to find one in downtown Seoul, where resorts are difficult to find. Last June, Ananti finally opened a hotel in the heart of Gangnam, Seoul. It is the unnamed T8 Gangnam. It has an exterior that you might pass by without realizing it is a notebook. Like this, Gangnam is an office building with a plan.  It blends in naturally with the hustle and bustle of Gangnam without standing out. Entering the ground floor entrance that seems to hide something, instead of the expected mob, a quiet guest room floor appears. Ananti Gangnam\u0027s nubi is located on the first floor, three floors down from the ground floor. When you enter by car, there is a lobby at the entrance where you leave your valet in the basement. While most businesses open their doors to outsiders, even non-guests, to use the silk makjang, Ananti Gangnam emphasizes that it is a high-bitan space strictly for guests. As a result, most of the nobi is located in the basement where guests leave their cars and enter. However, it is so stylish that it does not feel like a Robin Hood at all. The ceiling is made of glass, allowing natural light to come in, and the friendliness is high, so it does not feel stuffy at all. Since the concept of Anhan Ggang Nam itself is a small European village monastery, the red brick arches that gather wherever you look are impressive. The lobby where the front desk is located is also home to the hotel\u0027s lobby lounge and cafe space, Salon de Moby Dick. However, rather than serving food like a typical lounge, it only sells simple drinks, and most of them are not.  The space is being used for a briefing. The actual check-in was not done at the front desk, but rather, you sat in a chair and a staff member came to help you directly. After leaving the allergy, the lobby was right next to it, and you could check in right away while sitting in the lobby. This process was very clean and I felt like I was receiving a full refund. Now that check-in is complete, let\u0027s move on to the room. The room you\u0027ll see today is Cabin 6, located on the highest floor. It\u0027s unique. Starting from the 11th floor, instead of the tens digit, the number is indicated with a t, from support to t-1. It was Room 304 5, located on the 3rd floor, the highest floor. When you enter the room, you are greeted by a friend who feels very different from a regular hotel. The space itself is not as wide as you might think, but since it\u0027s 3 friends high, it doesn\u0027t feel stuffy and feels wide open. The sofa, table, and chairs used are colorful, but when you put them together, it doesn\u0027t look old-fashioned and goes well together. It\u0027s a sophisticated furniture that feels modern. One wall is decorated with orange lighting that reminds you of it when you don\u0027t go together. It\u0027s suitable for most banana peels.  It\u0027s a design, but since my friend is tall, it\u0027s also good for the guest room. The frequently picked carpet and the dark brown sofa gave it a sense of weight. One wall of the guest room is made of glass, so it\u0027s clear to see everything. It\u0027s hard to call it a terrace, but there is a space to go outside anyway. Ananti Villain Nam has two views: towards Hakdong Gokman and Cheongdam-dong. In fact, Gangnam itself is not a neighborhood with a great view, so whichever you choose, the view is pretty good. If you go up the stairs that start with marble that matches the sofa, it leads to the upper-floor bedroom. It\u0027s very unique and nice, but you might be worried about the safety of children staying in a family unit. Fortunately, the stairs themselves are not steep and there is no slope, so unless you have very young children, you don\u0027t have to worry too much. The upper-floor bedroom is a more comfortable space than the first-floor living room. The colors are decorated in wood tones, and the stairs, railings, walls, and ceiling are all curved, giving a sense of stability. All rooms in the planning site Nam have a standard occupancy of 4 people. As such, the beds are also all There are two rooms per week, and it feels like they are targeting families. The bed headboard and the brain are in a color that matches the body and the overall feeling of comfort, such as the stand and lighting. Across from the bed is a large window, but there is no TV that would be dim, but since there is no TV, there is no action in Gangnam, except for the family rooms. Instead, you can watch movies or dramas through the wave on the pad provided in the room. There is also a small desk where the pad is. The bathroom is located on the first floor. In fact, it seems to be the space with the highest level of design completion in the room. It is decorated using curves instead of straight lines, and it is decorated in pure white, giving it a clean and luxurious feel. From the toned-down floor to the wood-toned cabinets that continue from the room, there is nothing to criticize, and it makes me imagine that my bathroom at home would be great if it were decorated like this. Above all, the bathtub that seems to be attached to the arch wall is very pretty, as the corners are curved. The shower booth is also located inside, but the amenities are unique. Ananti has developed it for three years and is introducing the eco-friendly Ama Nikki Turbine.  This is De Poison, a product made with the goal of using plastic bottles for environmental protection. It provides solid shampoo, conditioner, face, body bar, soap, body lotion, and aloe vera gel. In fact, the three solid bar products were a bit confusing to use. However, if you want to protect nature and the environment, it is acceptable. There is a storage area and a closet at the bathroom entrance, and the 100% life-saving gown is unique and pretty. The slippers are not disposable but rubber slippers. The bathroom is also separated and located on the left side of the guest room entrance. There is a mini bar with 4 espresso coffee machines and tea, and the bottled water is made of eco-friendly materials from Ananti, like the Uhwajeong bottled water in the cabin. Most notably, the Mimi bar is very cheap despite being a luxury hotel. It is great that the issue of hotel guests having to go to the convenience store for three bottles of beer and other drinks has finally been raised. It is not together with the can. There are six types of rooms in total, including the cabin u you just saw. The differences and pros and cons of each room type will be introduced later in the video. First,  Let\u0027s go see the ambitiously decorated Hyung Jang in the 5th floor. A. The Spirit of Jeon-i Club, with its name, An Gye-su\u0027s suit and PT Neeson, is located on the surface floor, the lowest floor of the hotel. You check in here and then move to the indoor/outdoor pool or fitness center. First up is the indoor pool. It\u0027s a really, really pretty pool that captures the heart of the sensibility, making you wonder if a pool can be this pretty. As expected, it\u0027s designed in the shape of an arch that runs through the entire hotel. The 4th director\u0027s children are so pretty. In fact, one of the biggest factors that determines the atmosphere of the pool is the color of the tiles on the floor. The refreshingly colored floor tiles elevate the somewhat dark atmosphere. In addition, the landscaping that resembles a mysterious tropical rainforest at one end and the chairs and flower pots placed on the side suggest that this is not a simple capital city concept, but a modern reinterpretation of the space. Perhaps because the pool is not large and it\u0027s located underground, there\u0027s no view, so it\u0027s inevitable that it feels stuffy. However, trust is not everything. Gangnam also has an outdoor pool on the 3rd floor, and the arch decoration is no exception here. In fact, the location is Gangnam.  It\u0027s in the heart of the city and the pool is located on the relatively low third floor, so if there weren\u0027t an arch, it would be too open and exposed to the outside, which would feel awkward. The indoor pool is also equipped with plenty of seniors, so you can relax as if you were at a resort. However, the outdoor pool is also somewhat narrow. The path is a bit longer than the indoor pool, but it\u0027s narrow, so it\u0027s better to consider it difficult to swim even if there are only a few people. The pool at Gangnam is not unlimited use. You need to show the four tickets you received at check-in to use it. Each ticket is for one person, so up to four people can use it at the same time. During the peak season, the pool use time is divided into three time slots, and with one ticket, you can use both the indoor and outdoor pools unlimitedly during the same time slot. The high-end itself is not short, so it doesn\u0027t feel like there\u0027s not enough time, but the fact that there are limits on the number of users is a bit burdensome. In addition, the indoor and outdoor pools are too far apart, making it very inconvenient to go back and forth. The fitness center is located one floor up by stairs, so check-in is on the Q floor. The rules are different than the pool.  I was really shocked at Fitting Ace. In Korea, which 5-frame gym had flower decorations on 3 floors ? In addition, most gyms have a downside where the interior is not that great if the 3-frame is wide, and the interior is pretty but the equipment is not great, but An M Cap Gangnam Gym is definitely the best among hotel gyms in Korea. It is spacious and pretty, and has a wide variety of equipment. Oh, one downside is that the space is very small. There is a very small space with mats in the middle of the gym, and a yoga class called Spirit of Balance is held there every morning and evening. However, since the space is not separated by a wall, it feels a bit messy to concentrate on yoga. Now, let\u0027s take a look at breakfast. There are three food and beverage establishments in Hood, but two of them are actually ambiguous to call them food and beverage establishments. Poisson, a restaurant that serves breakfast, is practically the only food and beverage establishment. Wasong is a space that is a collection of all the interior elements we saw in 5-play. From the red brick and ceiling chandeliers to the silver- patterned sofa tables and curved furniture, it is all based on the concept of the entire hotel. It had a bright and cheerful appearance, as it was connected to the ground floor while maintaining a faithful appearance. When it first opened, it only served breakfast, but they said they would open for dinner soon. George, that\u0027s not a complete review. It \u0027s basically a course meal, with soup, bread, tea, and a main dish. A simple salad or dessert is also provided separately as a deep dish. May had a choice between meat or fish, and the grilled fish that came with the patient was also very tasty. I\u0027ll have to try the sirloin. Actually, I usually eat light in the morning, but whenever I go to a hotel, I think about the cost of breakfast and end up overeating. That\u0027s why I prefer this course meal. But that doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s completely empty. There are a variety of appetizer-style dishes, as well as wine and compote. The desserts and fruits aren\u0027t very diverse, but they\u0027re well- rounded, so I\u0027m very satisfied with the breakfast. However, breakfast is n\u0027t available at any time. You have to make a reservation by 10 p.m. the night before. However, there are times when breakfast is available, such as 11:30 a.m.  It was really good. I just slept in, checked in, ate, and went home. In addition, there are a few special services that I enjoy a lot because I don\u0027t have to worry about getting tired. First, there\u0027s the cart service. It\u0027s a free taxi service provided directly by Sotel. You can travel up to a 3km radius from the center of the retreat, but this isn\u0027t a straight line, it\u0027s a radius, so you can go further than you think. You probably need to make a reservation in advance through the app or the pad in the room. While the hotel ride is available, the return ride isn\u0027t. There\u0027s also a link service that provides special benefits for guests in partnership with 1D Class around Noh Tae-woo and Inba Spa and Nasa Shin-gwan. As a hotel located in Gangnam, the hottest area in Seoul, I plan to use the entire hotel as an auxiliary facility. Also, although it\u0027s only on weekends, there are programs for children in the small garden next to the hotel entrance in the evening. When checking out, there\u0027s a mobile check-out service through An Gap. No, there\u0027s no need to waste time waiting in line. So, what\u0027s your overall review of Gangnam? This is a novel, fresh, and pretty Opel, and even the domestic appeal is great.  Now, the hotel is also a Kot Ringa. I \u0027ve been really into Korean clothing, but sometimes I feel like it\u0027s all the same. There are n\u0027t many places where you can find a distinct hotel identity, but this one has a clear identity. One room has two worlds. First of all, the design itself is very novel and pretty. Moreover, it\u0027s consistent and luxurious, so it has a popular appeal that doesn\u0027t seem to be influenced by many tastes. I also liked that all the rooms are duplex, and the pool, gym, and breakfast are all excellent. Even the O-tae hallway and guest room doors are magnificent. I also applaud the innovative and practical attempts, such as the eco-friendly amenities, reasonable mini bar prices, and red bean service. While Gangnam has such a powerful appeal, it does have its own distinct drawbacks. First of all, the view is glorious, but there\u0027s no TV in the lobby, and there\u0027s no room service. Furthermore, because the fiber city is emphasized, we often feel the farmhouse or hustle and bustle as soon as we enter the hotel lobby. If you like traditional clothing and sensibilities, you might find it a bit boring. There\u0027s practically only one food and beverage establishment.  You might think, \"What\u0027s so special about this place?\" In fact, to compensate for such shortcomings, there is a link service for the cart service. Since everything, including services like Haman and breakfast reservations, must be used through the app, I think older people might find it a bit confusing. However, the biggest drawback is the price. The room I stayed in was the most expensive, excluding the family room, but it was over 800,000 won for one night on Friday and Saturday. And with the 10,000 won valet service, it was well over 1 million won. Even for a luxury hotel, it feels a bit excessive. However, this point is understandable. It\u0027s not a regular 5-tree hotel with an unspecified pin. It \u0027s a membership-based hotel. Members can use the hotel at a 20-40% discount. Therefore, if there is an original selling price, it should be charged more to non-members, and members should be treated more hostilely. From the perspective of regular guests, it can\u0027t help but feel a bit excessive. In addition, the standard occupancy is 20,000 won, that is, general.  You can\u0027t compare it to the hotel\u0027s Kibong room on the same level, but you have to compare the price range with the 7T room. So, when you think about the price of a 5-star hotel suite in Seoul that\u0027s popular these days, you might think it\u0027s around that level. However, this is how I understand it, as someone who is interested in hotels, and from the perspective of a regular guest, I answered, and how much is one night? From that perspective, it\u0027s a price that makes you tremble just to stay one night. I think the most reasonable way to use it is to find someone around you who has a membership and go with them. Here are some tips for when you\u0027re looking for a room. The cabin type and cabin fee that you saw in today\u0027s video are exactly the same. The only difference is the floor. The upper floor railing is blocked only in the 2-week room. If you\u0027re traveling with children, it would be better to use the 2-row room for safety. Cabin TSC has an island table and a large refrigerator instead of the orange closet and sofa space that you saw earlier. If you don\u0027t need a sofa but do need a table, you can use the 2-year-old room. Instead, the cabin tea is  If it\u0027s located on the lower floor, it\u0027s a room with a terrace. Cabin C gets some sunlight, but strictly speaking, it\u0027s located on the lower floor closer to the ground floor. Cabin S is located on the middle floor. But, the view that remains after one meal doesn\u0027t mean much, so I think it\u0027s better to just chase cost-effectiveness without worrying about the view. Cabin F is a family-type room, so there are two bedrooms and bathrooms on the first and second floors, but it\u0027s the largest room in Gangnam.

{"video_id":"J-80XPTT0zY","lang":"en","full_text":"One of the most important things about a hotel is the view, and a new hotel has appeared that will make the hearts of both the geeks and the view-obsessed flutter. Even the infinity pool with a view of the Han River is amazing. But are other features as great as the view? Which cancer did I pay for? Honestly, [Music] Hello, I am a Ttottonam. The hotel I will introduce today is Hotel Naru M Gallery, located at the northern end of Mapo Bridge. It is a hotel with an incredible view of the Han River that I would give 200 out of 100. There are four factors that make the view of M Galleria perfect. First, the hotel beach is a gangster. It is one of the hotels closest to the Han River among the Mongkapotels, and it is a big advantage that the Han River can be seen right in front of the hotel without any obstructions. The second factor that is even more important is the direction the hotel building faces. Usually, buildings with a view of the Han River are parallel to the Han River, so they face the Han River head-on. Unlike the M Gallery, which is located at the intersection at the northern end of Mapo Bridge, it inevitably faces the Han River at a 45-degree angle. That is why the already wide width of the Han River  It opens up a much wider field of vision. Also, because it faces west, you can perfectly enjoy Seoul\u0027s beautiful sunset. However, no matter how beautiful the river is, if you look at it for too long, it tends to feel flat. However, the view of the Han River from MGallery is not just a view of the Han River, but a much more diverse one as it embraces various landmarks. First, Bamseom, one of the few islands on the Han River, comes into view at a glance, and across the river, you can even see the skyscrapers of Yeouido. Mapo Bridge and Gangbyeonbuk-ro, which are like arteries of Seoul, with their constant flashes of light, play a role in bringing the view to life. And finally, the hotel is well aware of the advantages of this view and has maximized it in the design of its space. More than half of the rooms face the Han River, and there is an infinity pool with a Han River view that was never seen before. You can easily enjoy a perfect view from the hotel lobby, restaurant, or anywhere else. So, what do you think? Do you agree that it is a view that is enough to capture the heart of a nerd? Now, let\u0027s take a closer look at the hotel. Hotel Naru MGallery is a luxury boutique brand that corresponds to the premium class of the past 10 [Music]. There is also a hotel. Because it\u0027s located in Mapo-Naru, it\u0027s named Hotel Naru MGallery. The hotel is a three-minute walk from Exit 4 of Mapo Station. However, because it\u0027s located at the Mapo Bridge intersection, it can be a bit tricky to get to the hotel by car. Valet parking is required, which is quite expensive. This location was originally the headquarters of Poongdong Co., Ltd., one of Korea\u0027s top three fertilizer companies. Poongdong also owns Korea\u0027s MGallery. The hotel building has a unique, open-center structure, with the right side being an officetel building operated completely separately from the hotel. The first floor, known as the \"bedroom,\" serves as a welcome lounge where guests are greeted. Check-in is on the 20th floor. When the elevator doors open, you\u0027ll find a circular flowerbed, lush greenery, and a sculpture by Yang Ui-gyu hanging from the ceiling. The breathtaking view of the Han River outside the window doesn\u0027t draw much attention to the artwork. The high ceilings on the first floor, combined with the full-length windows, offer a breathtaking panoramic view of the Han River. The check-in counter and waiting area are located in front of the reception area. The place is not as big as you might think, but it is decorated with a decent modern feel. MGallery has five types of standard rooms and four types of suites. Let\u0027s first take a look at the Premier River Room, which has the best view of the Han River among the standard rooms. Entering through the arched hallway, you will find the bedroom. The room is clean and warm. The light wood-toned floor is neat and tidy without carpet, and the walls and furniture are decorated in white or neutral colors. The dark colors on the sofa, table, and bottom of the wall are used partially, making the neutral colors stand out even more. The simple design of the room is probably because one wall is occupied by a gorgeous view. This is the view of the Han River from the 17th floor. The view of the Han River from the room is also amazing. Since it is in the West, the afternoon sunlight is strong and it is a bit hot, but it is a view that you cannot give up. In fact, the Premier River Room and the Deluxe River Room are exactly the same room, and the only difference is the floor. This is the view of the Han River from the 12th floor, a Deluxe River Room. The view from the 12th floor is not bad, but it is definitely better to take in more of the Han River from a higher place. One drawback is that  If I had to pick one thing, the sofa was quite awkwardly positioned for a view of the Han River from bed. I wondered if it would have been better if it had been positioned facing the work table. The hotel is so obviously focused on tourism that there isn\u0027t much difference between the room sizes, but if you want to feel more relaxed, the 125 line might be a better option. The bathroom, decorated with bright marble, is compact and tightly divided, with a single sink, a separate toilet, and even a bathtub. The green tiles behind the bathtub add a touch of character, and bath salts are provided. However, in a round bathtub of this size, you can\u0027t stretch your legs. While it looks pretty, it\u0027s not practical. Amenities include reusable containers of Grow Alchemist products from the Australian natural cosmetics brand. A beautifully curved minibar offers capsule coffee and Althaus tea, along with a variety of cups and a coffee pot. The hallway near the entrance has a luggage storage area and a closet. As you\u0027ve seen inside Winnie the Pooh, the hotel uses orange throughout. You\u0027ll find it in down jackets, slippers, and even the welcome card. For a higher vantage point, consider staying in the Premier River Suite. There are six rooms, three per floor, on the 24th floor, with separate living and bedrooms. At 63 square meters, the space is certainly spacious, so the windows are larger and the same Han River view seems much larger. A table is also provided for Ae-myung to sit at. Like the standard rooms you saw earlier, the suites are neat and tidy, with subtle touches here and there, showcasing a design that everyone will love. The inner bedroom has a bed and a table. Unlike the standard rooms, there\u0027s no long sofa in front of the window, so the Han River view is much more open. The stand design is also thoughtfully designed, befitting a suite. Passing through the luggage storage area, you\u0027ll find the bathroom, which is much larger, with two sinks. While it might be a bit small to stretch your legs out in, it also has a larger bathtub than the standard rooms. As a suite, there\u0027s a second guest bathroom at the entrance, and a styler is also included. The Bamseom Suite is a higher-end suite with a two-way view of the hotel. The living room is even larger than the standard suite, and the Han River view from there is trulyspectacular. It even has a large sofa and a six-person table, making it ideal for parties or VIPs.  It looks perfect for small events. The atmosphere continues from the standard rooms, but the furniture adds a touch of flair. On the opposite side is the bedroom, with a unique stand-up TV in front of the window. Finally, there\u0027s a bathroom with a long bathtub where you can stretch your legs. The bedroom faces the back of the hotel building, with a view of Namsan Mountain. I thought I\u0027d see an apartment complex around Mapo Station in the back, but I can see Namsan Mountain from afar. Unusually, you can also see Lotte Tower across the Han River. The hotel is capitalizing on this by promoting Namsan Mountain as a view from rooms at the back, where the Han River is not visible. The Premier Namsan Room you\u0027re looking at now has a view of Namsan Mountain alongside the apartment complex. The room is a bit smaller, but it has a sofa and table in front of the bed, so it could be an option for those who want to sit and watch TV. Unusually, the Namsan View Room at the back has a bathtub with a shower booth, but instead has a larger bathtub. The last room you\u0027ll see is the Family Twin, a family room. It \u0027s located only on the third floor of the hotel, and as expected from a family room, it has a thick double bed. A total of four people, including children and adults, can stay there. However, because it\u0027s on the third floor, the hotel\u0027s biggest advantage is that it has a sofa and table in front of the bed, so it could be an option for those who want to sit and watch TV.  The Han River view is a bit disappointing. Hotel Naru M Gallery has many auxiliary facilities and sign shops that take advantage of the view. Let \u0027s take a look at the swimming pool, which you\u0027re probably most curious about. The outdoor infinity pool on the 20th floor, which was also featured in the video thumbnail, is truly a legendary swimming pool. Of course, like most infinity pools in the city, it\u0027s not the perfect size for swimming. It looks quite large, but about a third is a shallow space for sunbeds, and the actual immersion space is about two-thirds of the front. However, this place is originally meant for immersing yourself and admiring the scenery rather than swimming. Moreover, since the officetel is located at the top, the view is close to the south, facing Yeouido. It even served as a hidden harp when the fireworks festival was held in Yeouido not long ago. The infinity pool, which allows you to see the Han River from west to east at a glance, is a view that makes you proud to be a Seoul citizen, and a view that would rival any other in the world. However, it is currently scheduled to operate only until December, and it is said to be closed for a while during the winter and reopen next spring. Fortunately, the indoor pool, which is open even in the middle of winter, has a panoramic view. The view of the Han River from the window is just as good as that of the outdoor pool. It \u0027s a bit narrow, but it\u0027s 25 meters long, and there\u0027s a shallow children\u0027s pool at one end. Not only are the arched pillars surrounding the pool, but mirrors are hung on the ceiling to reflect the pool. It\u0027s not a particularly fancy pool, but it\u0027s a clean and well-designed space. The fitness center is located in the back, out of sight, but the high ceilings make it feel comfortable. While the equipment isn\u0027t extensive, it has everything you need, including cardio equipment and power racks. Let\u0027s take a look at the Sig restaurant, which has a view as beautiful as the infinity pool. The French restaurant Buhajaeng, located on the 22nd floor, also serves breakfast. You can see the Han River from any table. The inner space, in particular, offers a full view of Yeouido toward the 63 Building, making it a hidden gem for the fireworks festival. The river view diminishes at night, so I personally recommend going for lunch or around sunset rather than dinner. I had dinner here with friends, and honestly, the food and service were a bit disappointing compared to the view.  I thought about it. Breakfast is also served at Buhajaeng. They take your coffee order upon seating. You can order egg dishes or waffles at your table. I ordered a waffle, but it was really lacking. I usually like crispy waffles, but I really enjoyed them. The buffet menu is also quite excellent. Of course, it may have opened early, but the menu composition and the taste of the food were all excellent. At the entrance to Buhajaeng, there is Buhajaeng, a bar that is popular among hotel guests. They say it is decorated with the concept of a herbal medicine store. In fact, if they didn\u0027t explain it, it would be hard to tell that it is Korean, but after hearing the explanation, there are traditional patterns here and there. The lobby where check-in is done has a lounge and deck. It is not a large space, but thanks to the high-rise building and the amazing view, the atmosphere is just like that of a large hotel lounge. You can have afternoon tea or light alcoholic beverages here. Finally, there is Cafe Mapo A on the first floor. This is not a hotel facility, but a casual cafe and bakery that the general public can use comfortably. So, what would be the overall review of Hotel Naro M Gallery? The most perfect.  This is the best hotel in Seoul, boasting a view of the Han River. I\u0027ve praised it as much as I did the Evie Plaza before, but the view alone is truly the best in Seoul and rivals any hotel in the world. While I had expected the view to some extent, I was pleasantly surprised by how good the overall hotel design was. The overall design of the hotel doesn\u0027t seem to be overly hip, but rather subdued, yet still manages to capture the essence. Anyone can tell that this place has a great atmosphere and is well-decorated. The guest rooms have beautiful views, the breakfast is delicious, and the pool is nice. In fact, Dosi Mokangs has almost everything. However, because it\u0027s a boutique hotel, it lacks the grandeur and grandeur of a five-star hotel like the Conrad or Fairmont across the street. When you actually go there, you might find it a bit smaller than you\u0027d expect. It seems to compete with the two hotels in Yeouido facing the Han River, but I personally don\u0027t think the Conrad or Fairmont can compete with the view at all. If I had to choose one of the three, I would definitely choose the MGallery. However, the two hotels in Yeouido definitely have a strong presence, as do the guest rooms.  It\u0027s spacious and the interior is much more luxurious. It\u0027s also good for a water vacation, but in this respect, you might feel that the MGallery is a little boring. Anyway, the MGallery is a great hotel that appeared in the middle of Seoul unexpectedly, and I definitely want to visit this hotel again.

In the next video, I\u0027ll be back with a review of Singapore Airlines, one of the top airlines in the world. Then, I was a man who flies flowers and left again. Thank you. [Music]"}
{"video_id":"EwBfFU0eNLM","lang":"en-US","full_text":"The LOTTE World Tower is the tallest in South  Korea and the 5th tallest in the entire world. It is a shining beacon, a symbol of the city of  Seoul. If you were to Google Seoul right now, it\u0027s probably one of the first images that  comes up. The mega-conglomerate LOTTE decided to build an ultra-luxury hotel at the very  top of this tower from floors seventy six to a hundred and seven. They brought in a  three Michelin-starred chef from France, a world class service team and top  contemporary artists from Asia and called it The Signiel. It is a Leading  Hotel of the World, classified as six stars and quickly is becoming one of the very  best. So of course I had to do a full review! I reviewed out of 50 points in five categories.  The categories are The Ambiance, The Room, The Dining, The Service and The It-Factor.  It’s hard to explain what it is like to stay a hundred stories up in the air, so let’s  start on the ground floor and work our way up. This is the ground floor of the LOTTE  Tower. This is really the only thing on floor one. It’s not technically part of  the hotel. It’s across the street from LOTTE World, which is like Korea’s Disney  land which after doing some digging I’ve realized that LOTTE owns a lot of South  Korea; from malls, to amusement parks and this tower itself. So Signiel is their  luxury property, and from what I can tell, they pulled out all of the stops to make this  exceptional. I mean just look at this entrance. Look at this. This is the lobby for the  Signiel Hotel. So on my left we have the check in desk and concierge. On my right is a  high-end pastry shop where they’re literally encased in glass. You can see that no expense  has been spared in building this and designing it. In-fact, they brought in some well-known  artists: my favorite piece is the chandelier here which is called \"An Aggregation\". Just an  incredible lobby but for now let’s keep going up. So up on the 85th floor is a full  pool overlooking the city. You literally are swimming in the sky. And over here there’s a  full cold-plunge pool which if you’ve seen any of my other videos on the channel like Hotel  Bel-Air or The Ritz Carlton in Puerto Rico, you’ll know I have to try this a little bit later. A little higher up now is The Retreat Spa at  the Signiel. It is one of the most minimalistic and aesthetically pleasing spas that I have seen.  They even have an oil atelier that helps you pick the oils before your treatment. Now you might  know that Korea is famous for its skin care, its hair care, so we had to stop the tower  climb and give these treatments a try. So I’m getting the Korean skin care treatment  and hair treatment today, it\u0027s 90 minutes. That was insane. It was a multi-step facial and hair cleansing treatment.  Alright let’s keep going. Alright so we are high enough now that you  can really get that panoramic view of Seoul right below the tower is the Han River  and this is the Salon de Signiel which is a library you can sit, order a coffee, read  your books and know that you are higher than 99.9% of the rest of the world. So it\u0027s  not the dining segment yet but they have two different beans here, it\u0027s 79 and  123 named after the floors in the tower. So good, and it’s gonna motivate  me to go work out, so let’s go see the gym. So here in the fitness center, there’s a  wide diversity of different types of equipment and machines that you can use and in the locker room  the attendant actually gives you complimentary socks, pants, and shirts to work out in. The gym  itself is actually very modern with some great equipment. It’s also pretty spacious for a tower  like this, so I was overall impressed with the gym. Okay, so those are the public spaces here  at the Signiel. What you didn’t see is that above the 107th floor is the  Observation Deck and the Sky Bridge both of which are reviewed in my friend Alex Brown’s  video, he’s here in Seoul with me, The Top 10 In South Korea, but both are not technically  part of the hotel. But overall, everything is very well designed and very very clean.  It feels like a brand new hotel. The gym is excellent and well appointed, the spa is  very aesthetic, although minimalistic, even so it still has that kind of cold and corporate  feel, which you just get being in a sky scraper. So we’ve seen some better decor in other  hotels. It\u0027s a relatively small hotel with the floors they have, but they make good use of the  space that they do have. I gave The Ambience an 8/10. Now let’s get out of this  ice pool and continue our journey up the tower. There are 235 rooms at  The Signiel ,and I got one of the highest because you have to see the view from the bathroom. So I  don\u0027t normally start with the bathroom, but come on you have to when you have a view like this  from the bathtub. The bathroom feels a lot like the rest of The Signiel, which is a ton of granite,  very modern, clean lines, the lighting is excellent. Fades on when you turn it on, fades off. Everything  is remote controlled including the curtains over here. Minimalistic, clean, but also potentially  a little bit cold, but definitely luxurious. You got a set of robes kind of hidden  down there in a little seat for you. They also give you some bath salts here, two  different types. Kind of funny there\u0027s these signs that say slippery all throughout the  bathroom, there\u0027s a few of them in here. Never seen that in a hotel. And of course you have  another one of those modern Japanese toilets which you know I love those. So like always I have  to test the shower. Now the Shower Test is 3 criteria points: that is The Pressure, The Size  of the shower, and the Ease of Use. Let\u0027s start with the size, it is a comfortable shower. There\u0027s  an overhead shower and a handheld here and it\u0027s kind of like you\u0027re enclosed in granite. Ease  of Use, I can tell you, it\u0027s pretty simple. You turn this on, sprays to the side there. Pull this  out, and the shower comes down. The Pressure is pretty good, I would say, it got hot right away.  Pressure is solid, Size is solid, and Ease of Use is solid. The only downside, you have to  get in the shower to actually turn it off. Heading back into the room now, on this  side of the room you have your mini bar area which has a refrigerator, a full tea  set, coffee pods with an espresso machine. Over here they left out some tea for us  with some dried fruit and a newspaper, everything is branded Signiel. And of course,  the bed. I cannot wait to test this bed, it\u0027s an Italian bedding company called Frete,  it\u0027s in every room here at the Signiel. I\u0027m going to sleep on this tonight, do a full  bed test, and of course I\u0027ll let you know in the morning how good the sleep is. On this  side, the entire wall here is the view of Seoul. So outside of the standard Room with a  view, there are the suites here, like the Korean Suite and the Royal Suite, which can go for  as much as $15,000 dollars a night. All right, so I want to give this  bed an official test tonight. It\u0027s apparently an incredible night\u0027s  sleep according to the reviews online. So I can honestly say that was one of the best  night\u0027s sleep I have had in my entire life. This bed is truly next level, and the view when  you open your curtains in the morning... Wow! It\u0027s time to give an official Room Score. So this  was one of the harder room scores for me to give out of all of the rooms on this channel. It\u0027s a  very modern room, everything from the lighting to the toilet, the drapery and the auto-close-auto-open next to the bed, everything felt intuitive and very easy to use. The positives - the view  from the room is the best that we\u0027ve seen so far anywhere in the world, I mean absolutely amazing  day and night from the bathtub, to the bed when you wake up. The shower is modern and clean, and the  bed - absolutely exceptional. Sleep was wonderful. On the negative side, it felt cold, corporate, and  sterile, like a lot of this hotel does and the decor wasn\u0027t really beautifully integrated into  the hotel like some of the rooms I\u0027ve reviewed on this channel so far. All in all, everything in  the room was very comfortable and very modern, just a little bit too polished maybe for my liking. I  gave the room a 7.5/10. Now I had dreams about those pastries all night,  so let\u0027s go downstairs and give them a try. So they serve them during the tea set here in the lounge and I cannot wait to try them. I like your suit very nice! So in the lounge here, they have  something called the Le Gouter Tea Above the Clouds. It\u0027s a full tea  setup, we\u0027re about to get it right now. The display is absolutely stunningly  beautiful, everything you could want for like a midday tea service. It\u0027s a mixture of sweet  and savory. That\u0027s pretty good... I don\u0027t know about the sweet mixed with the shrimp? It\u0027s a little dry not what I was expecting. The taste is really nice, absolutely. Jelly Bean jelly. The texture of that is really strange. that was not my favorite. This is a  truffle paté sandwich. That is is the best thing so far, yeah really great. Gold leaf. This reminds me of Brazil Pao de Quejo, which is the kind of cheese bread. Wow, you would eat this and immediately go  into a coma! Last but not least the very top here look at this wow, very soft almost like a soufflé  but everything is a little bit sweeter than what we have in the United States. Definitely going to  contribute to the dining score. There are two main restaurants here at the Signiel which both have  Michelin stars, in fact their chef is from France and has three Michelin stars himself. The two main  restaurants are STAY, which is a modern French restaurant, and BICENA which is a traditional  Korean.They\u0027re both multi-course menus. This is BICENA, the first of the two  internationally recognized restaurants. It is a multi-course Korean menu today, I can\u0027t wait to try  it and show you if it\u0027s as good as its reputation. Some Michelin restaurants have appetizers that you have before the dishes, here  they serve a welcome drink. Really impressed so far, not only in the flavor, but  also in the plating. The presentation here looks like it has been staged for a professional photo  shoot. So our server mentioned that these were made purely out of shiitake mushrooms. These are  works of art as they come out, absolutely amazing. Wow! Look at that. Very much feels like a comfort  dish - the soup and the chicken for the dessert course. You have three pine nuts in a Korean  punch. It has a heavy cinnamon. Orbs with persimmon in there. Wow! Did not love the texture of that. That is shocking. It explodes! This is a burdock and potato ice cream. Woah. I\u0027ve noticed that  in Korea that they lean it to more like earthy flavors and things we don\u0027t really get in the  United States. Really nice end to an excellent meal. Now let\u0027s go try the second of the two Michelin  restaurants they have. Checking in for Walker. We\u0027re here for dinner in STAY, which is a French  inspired modern restaurant here at the hotel. Three Michelin starred Chef Yanek created this menu  specifically for this hotel. So they started with the appetizer here which usually sets the tone  for the rest of the dinner. That\u0027s very nice. Wow that was really strange. I don\u0027t know if I love  the flavor on that one. Look at the presentation so far it is an anchovy in the center with a  cream sauce around the outside, there is a lot of gold flake so far, I will say, on all of these  dishes so we\u0027ll see if that continues. Let\u0027s give it a try. Okay not what I expected. The anchovy  in the middle is kind of like a dry cardboard very unique flavors absolutely very unique. So  this the second dish, this one is a doughnut with scallop inside of it. To be honest I was getting  a little worried with the first couple of dishes that came out; just some odd flavors, but that  is the best dish so far kind of tastes like a crepe a very soft crepe with caviar inside.  This really has made up for it. So now we have the ravioli with cheese inside of it, it\u0027s kind  of a wet dish overall, but the flavor is really excellent. We\u0027re a couple bites in now and it\u0027s turned  into more of a soup than a pasta I would say. Incredible presentation. I am a huge fan of  soufflés, it\u0027s my favorite dessert so I could not be more excited to try this one. Really dark chocolate mixed with the light vanilla and the Grand Marnier especially for the brownie lovers  out there it\u0027s like a brownie with ice cream but elevated to the highest degree. At this point in  the dinner probably have an entire gold bar in my stomach the dining options here are pretty  incredible and the fact that they have two 1 Michelin star restaurants in the same building  is really amazing we\u0027ve never seen that before on the channel. Many people stay here because of the  gastronomic experiences you can have, it\u0027s time to close out the dining and give it a final score but  there is one more thing to show you on this floor. So this is the final stop in the dining here at  The Signiel, this is Bar 81 which is a very dimly lit very cool Seoul bar, it actually is the  largest champagne collection in the entire country. The dining here was truly incredible two Michelin  restaurants, the plating is exceptional, and the views from the restaurant are amazing. We  have seen some other hotels that do have even better dining opportunities on-site, so I  gave the dining an 8.5/10. So the service at the dining was definitely  great and very very attentive, but we can\u0027t really give the Service Score until  we do that official Service Test. The Service Test is the part of the review where  I call the front desk and request something a little bit strange or different than what they\u0027re  used to. In the past we\u0027ve requested pillow forts, towel animals, even floral arrangements that  match the lobby. The service at the signal has been really high level, so I had to think  of something creative to put them to the test. I have kind of a strange request for you, I was  hoping to do a movie night tonight in the room and I was wondering if someone from your team  could help us set up the room to feel like a movie theater? yes no problem. Hello it\u0027s Ryan. You do not have it? Okay no problem, would it be  possible to have some popcorn brought up to the room? Yes, just to watch movies  with. Yes, no problem. Hi there, I was hoping to have a movie night tonight, is it possible to order some popcorn to the room? No popcorn. Even if it was at a store if I paid to have someone bring it. Oh okay, thank you. Bye. Anything that is outside of the realm of the  normal service that they provide for their guests has been shut down. So you saw that just  now, of course most hotels would not be able to set up the room like a theater but most if  you paid for it would offer to go and grab some popcorn from a market next door or at least  attempt it. However the service at the restaurant has been really good, this will be a tough score  to give. What I think is important in the luxury hotel space is having fluidity and flexibility  with guests, depending on their situations or current specific needs, and I felt like at the Signiel  they were really acting by protocol - acting by the book. That can sometimes feel rigid and a  little bit stiff which unfortunately impacts the score. I gave the Service here a 7.5/10. We\u0027ve now seen almost every floor here at the Signiel but there  is one left at the very top: The Observation Deck. So here on the 127th floor is the observation deck, which actually is not part of the hotel,  but it is a perfect place to talk about the It-Factor. Now the It-Factor for any hotel  is that special thing that makes it different or unique it makes you want to come back to  it again and again. The It-Factor for this hotel of course is right behind me; this  view is incredible at the fifth tallest building in the world it\u0027s absolutely epic.  I gave the it-factor an 8/10. So that is the Signiel Hotel one of the  top rated hotels on the channel so far. It\u0027s time to give it that final score out  of 50, and sadly to check out. If you add all of the scores together from this video,  the Signiel hotel in Seoul, South Korea got a 39.5/50. If  you want another hotel in a big city like this, check out the Cosmopolitan in Las  Vegas. If you\u0027re looking for something more tropical and in the jungle, The Ritz  Carlton Dorado Beach is a perfect fit. I\u0027m Ryan Walker, thank you for  watching, we\u0027ll see you on the next one."}

{"video_id":"DRNfhi0QBoE","lang":"en","full_text":"Introducing a special hotel located just a 5-minute walk from SinNonhyeon Station in the trendy Gangnam area of South Korea! This hotel offers great value with breakfast, sauna, and even free late-night snacks, making it a popular choice for both locals and foreigners. When we visited in February 2025 on a weekend, the price for a room with breakfast for two was around 200,000 KRW. This hotel is part of the Japanese Kyoritsu Group chain, known for its meticulous attention to detail and friendly service that reflects Japan’s hospitality culture. At the lobby, they offer unlimited welcome drinks, along with a coffee machine, tea bags, ice, and water dispenser, providing various convenient amenities. There’s also a computer and printer available for business travelers, making it convenient to get work done. The hotel has a total of 220 rooms, and when we visited, it was fully booked, reflecting its high popularity. While the room we stayed in wasn’t very large, the spacious window design made it comfortable and airy. Considering its location in Gangnam, we found the size and price to be reasonable. Inside the room, you\u0027ll find indoor wear and slippers for use at the hot springs, and the bed features a Simmons mattress made in Japan, ensuring a comfortable night\u0027s sleep. The bathroom is small but well-designed, with a powerful shower and splash-proof design, showcasing the hotel’s attention to detail. Additionally, it supports both 220V and 110V outlets, making it very convenient to use electronic devices. However, one downside to the room was the light from the switch next to the bed, which could be a little bothersome during sleep. The highlight of the hotel is the Japanese-style hot spring located on the basement floor. The large bath with artificial hot spring water includes a healing spa and sauna, with separate male and female baths. After enjoying the hot springs, you can indulge in free late-night ramen (yonaki soba) served from 9PM to 10:30PM—perfect to end your day. The breakfast, while not quite on the level of a luxury hotel, is substantial enough to start your day. The grilled white fish and probiotic drink were particularly impressive, and the freshness of the ingredients was satisfying. If you\u0027re looking to relax in a hot spring, enjoy a hearty breakfast, and experience all this at a reasonable price in the heart of Gangnam, don\u0027t miss the special experience at Dormy Inn Seoul Gangnam!"}

staircase this property opened in 2012 and it\u0027s one of the most premier and expensive  hotels in Soul this is where you walk in this is the spiral staircase and right over here  is where you

doing the best five hotels starting here moving to Juju Island and then we\u0027ll  be back in Seoul for the remainder of the hotels so stay tuned you aren\u0027t going to want to miss  them because many of them have a chance to get a perfect score being one of the top hotels in the  world let\u0027s go check in and check out the rooms [Music] all right we just landed in Soul South Korea  here we are we are up here at the corner room on the 35th floor 3516 this is the end of the  hallway corner room so we have the whole view this way and this way really cool wood key cards  that are purple just gorgeous and everything is wood this property opened in 2012 and it\u0027s with  Hilton as I mentioned but this is probably the best Conrad room in the world not this specific  room but just just these rooms here in general even though it\u0027s an older property this is just  gorgeous it is timeless elegance kind of like the Ritz Carlton Kyoto this is such a beautiful room  but right away this is the most unique designed cubby area I\u0027ve ever seen and how perfectly it\u0027s  lit you know how much I love lights and lighting this is gorgeous and it\u0027s all wooden here and  look we have the kettle the espresso machine complimentary waters they\u0027re in plastic but still  glad they\u0027re in there we have beautiful down here tea assortment espresso capsules glasses this is  the most beautifully displayed mini bar area I\u0027ve almost ever seen this is fantastic down below here  we have drinks in this cooler we also have dental kit and then we have this really cool like razor  but this actually says like Conrad it has the building on it that\u0027s what the building looks like  it\u0027s one of the coolest buildings in Seoul this is just incredible but real quick I want to show  you the room and then I\u0027ll show you the closet and the bathroom because the room here is just  insane look at this room this is gorgeous this is high ceilings the corner room here it\u0027s a little  bit more spacious than the standard rooms they do allow you to fit four guests in the room here  that has the two queen beds so two beautiful queen beds but it\u0027s so sophisticated for being an older  property it still looks insane it looks incredible i love the bedding pillows look so plush you even  have this really cool beautiful silver framing around the pillows the backboard here is gorgeous  it\u0027s not really a flat wall this is like a woven texture and that art piece it\u0027s actually fits  the design of the room very nice with the back lit lighting now the beds are incredible i like  how there\u0027s two of them you also have the wood here and then you have the darker nightstands and  you have night three nightstands so you whether someone\u0027s like sleeping on each side everyone  gets their own nightstand which is really nice a little speaker here which I think is Bluetooth  which is great i love that because some people like to play their own music and I love these  lights on the end they\u0027re almost like lanterns they\u0027re just gorgeous like they\u0027re so special of  the lights we have a whole like it\u0027s not an iPad but it\u0027s just like a control pad here and look  at this let me go and press this button we have automatic blinds yes and this hotel opened in 2012  so if this hotel can have automatic blinds every luxury hotel in the world should have automatic  blinds or it should not be a luxury hotel just gorgeous and they\u0027re complete blackout shades so  that\u0027s what I look for you also have a whole bunch of other controls over here you can set an alarm  lights off lights on you have the makeup room you can adjust different temperature even for the  thermostat all right and the controls actually work you press the button it actually does what  it\u0027s supposed to do which is just fantastic everything here is just flawless i love the carpet  even though it\u0027s all carpet and not hardwood it\u0027s still nice now they could have put maybe an  ottoman in front of the bed that would have given you a little bit more maybe space to put  your luggage but regardless you have plenty of counter space on this side now over here we have a  little seating area it\u0027s nice because you can look out here at this incredible view we are towering  over most of the other buildings here in Seoul in a great location this is just beautiful so we not  only have this view but then we also have the view over on this side which is right next to the TV  but this view also is just as spectacular we\u0027re looking out here over this bridge the water there  the other buildings it\u0027s fantastic now this is a really cool work desk because a lot of hotels like  this are more business hotels so there\u0027s a lot of people here in business that do need a good work  desk and this is very inspiring i would love to work here on my laptop you\u0027re sitting here you  have the view this is a really cool light just beautiful phone and then over here like this is  so extra what is a Dyson hair dryer doing over in the room this honestly should be in the bathroom  but it\u0027s over here in front of this mirror so when you shower and you need to dry your hair off you  can come right on over here and use your Dyson but that\u0027s so extra cuz these are so expensive but  that is really cool that that\u0027s there but this is such a cozy room i love it now let\u0027s take  a look real quick at the uh closets and the shower because the bathroom area is also just as  spectacular okay now here I almost missed this but this closes off here and it closes the bathroom  in and then here you can store your luggage we have a luggage rack hangers and I love how it\u0027s  lit and it\u0027s just all wood even up here it\u0027s so extra and then down here we have the other closets  we have two closets this one is what has the robe and the slippers and take a look at these robes i  do approve of these robes because they\u0027re actually very soft and they say Conrad like these are  luxurious you come out of the shower you put one of these on relax in your suite in your room here  so high and then down below there are slippers in the room waiting for you which I every luxury  property should have i can\u0027t believe the ones that miss it but these slippers look very nice now  they\u0027re not that thick so I give these maybe like a medium score because they\u0027re not super plush  but they\u0027re not super terrible either so this kind of a mid on the slippers but definitely  good on the robes i just wanted to point this out but do you notice how the light is inside the  bar where you hang your clothes on incredible it would almost feel like this hotel like recently  opened it\u0027s I was not expecting this at all but here we are now the bathroom gorgeous bathroom  like we have the marbling floor to the walls all the way up indented lighting we have toilet  beautiful toilet area beautiful shower area and rainfall shower huge rainfall shower with those  special soaps and handheld all marble huge a lot of sometimes showers are very small towels here  really cool towel bar like nothing here is coming apart nothing here looks like it\u0027s old it\u0027s all  just beautiful i\u0027m so impressed i love the sinks we have two sinks two people can be getting ready  we have a TV built right in to the sink so you can be watching TV and then here\u0027s really cool  these are the amenities for the for the Here we have a comb shower cap vanity kit and together  they form the building skyline with the Conrad just so extra beautiful gorgeous i love the  bathroom so comfortable now we do have this kind of see-through into the room so I\u0027m not  sure if that closes off or if it\u0027s just like that so you can see into the room while you\u0027re  showering and you want to take a good look outside but it doesn\u0027t offer a lot of privacy so I\u0027m not  sure if this can close off or not but it\u0027s neat that the rooms do here have tubs as well i think  even all the standard rooms here do have tubs i have to double check but it\u0027s just awesome that  it\u0027s here and you could be sitting on this end looking out still at the view from a distance  but it\u0027s beautiful it\u0027s just so well done with the marbling the lighting under here this is an  incredible bathroom overall I am so happy to be in Seoul i\u0027m so happy to be here at the Conrad  this hotel has just exceeded my expectations i walked in the lobby here 8 years ago when I was  visiting and I dreamed of staying here one day so I\u0027m finally here and it has it\u0027s it\u0027s almost  like it just opened this is a beautiful property we\u0027ll see how the other hotels are we\u0027re doing  the best five hotels in Korea South Korea in about a week so we\u0027re doing J Island tomorrow  the JW Marriott there but I want to show you the rest of the Conrad because they have a lot  of really amazing amenities here including the pool breakfast one of the coolest concier club  lounges so I want to show it all to you let\u0027s go welcome to the Conrad Soul which opened in 2012  this is one of the flagship Conrad hotels in Asia it\u0027s in the UIo area which is Soul\u0027s financial and  media district but what\u0027s cool is that even though you\u0027re in the business district you\u0027re right on  the Han River and the hotel is part of the IFC mall complex which is attached to it so there\u0027s  a lot of shopping and things in the local area to do this property is absolutely stunning it is  my first time to ever stay at a Conrad property with Hilton which I would say is Hilton\u0027s loyalty  program\u0027s top luxury brand along with Walderof Atoria the rival entrance is extremely grand but  it can also be quite busy the property is quite large they have a lot of guest rooms about 434  you can tell the property was built to very high standards because even though it was built in  opened in 2012 it still feels relatively new it has not aged basically at all it\u0027s stunning  the lobby is one of the most grand lobbies you\u0027ll find in the world with this stunning spiral  staircase and the illuminated lighting everywhere i love all the beautiful color tones of the wood  as well as the marble floors you also have these amazing elevator bays which go all the way to  the spa facilities meeting rooms other things then you have the main elevators which take you  up to the guest room floors when you first walk in you do have the concier\u0027s desk and the luggage  assistants we had the bags they took them when we got there and they delivered them promptly to  our room service was really nice even though that port kosher can get kind of busy there\u0027s usually  people there to help you and it just feels like the place like it\u0027s happening here like this is  the hotel I feel like everyone wants to stay at there\u0027s just always a lot of action and it really  is stunning i was really impressed with the live plants the friendly people in the lobby and just  the overall design it\u0027s truly a special lobby not all luxury hotels in the world have such large and  grand lobbies like this so it definitely sets the tone for a wonderful stay our check-in experience  was flawless with the status with Hilton if you have the diamond status which we were fortunate to  have they did offer a upgrade to the corner room with the two beds unfortunately they don\u0027t give  any suite upgrades here which is disappointing which I found with the Hilton loyalty program very  few hotels ever give you a sweet upgrade even with their highest loyalty status unlike Marriott  or Hyatt which tend to give a lot more sweet upgrades I\u0027ve noticed with their top tier status  check-in was also very smooth they offered us the complimentary breakfast in the main restaurant  and asked us if we wanted a little bit of a late checkout they then took us to the elevator and  then we went in they actually have quite a few floors it goes all the way up pretty high we were  on almost the highest floor but the stunning thing is as soon as you get out of the elevators you\u0027re  going to notice the hallways in the elevator bay they are stunning beautiful lighting fixtures i  loved the carpeting i loved all the wood paneling the sides of the walls the ceiling everything was  absolutely flawless it reminded me a little bit of the Ritz Carlton in Kyoto just with all the cool  wood and lighting it\u0027s just really special i would totally come back here it didn\u0027t feel like it aged  at all even here at the end they have that cool wood kind of division panel with the beautiful  views of the city now of course this was our room i loved the corner room it was much better than  the photos the photos I just picked this hotel for like a layover hotel before we would fly to  Jju Island the next day but this hotel actually ended up being our favorite hotel on the whole  trip overall the room design the service the breakfast everything about this place just left us  wanting more so if we ever come back to Korea we definitely want to stay at this property again  now this is the next morning this is heading to breakfast it is at the restaurant called Zest  there\u0027s also another restaurant on this floor here to the right which I will show you a little  bit later but as we continue to walk around you\u0027ll see there\u0027s the zest and it\u0027s just the  floor above the lobby level as you can see that spiral staircase continues up there they saved and  reserved a special table for us it even had like a little sign for diamond member which is really  cool i wish that maybe Haidider Marriott did something like that have special table areas for  maybe like Titanium and Ambassador members here was the breakfast buffet one of the most stunning  and unique breakfast buffet designs I\u0027ve ever seen i loved the black fixtures around the counters the  salad bar every detail was just immaculate you had the cool lighting you had all the different  stations for whatever type of food you wanted and it wasn\u0027t overly crowded and it wasn\u0027t too  like spread out it was kind of all here in very good positions it just felt very comfortable  very natural and just beautiful no matter where you looked they have the noodle bar there where  they\u0027ll make you any kind of custom noodle dish they had everything from western style dishes  from eggs and hash browns and pancakes and things like that to even Asian dishes as well as even  just all kinds of in between foods like fried chicken and different unique things here was  some international food I think even like curry and different items from other countries  they have a lot of different options here they also offer made to order eggs they\u0027ll make  you unlimited cappuccinos lattes they have a lot of Korean options like bulgogi or rice porridge  and kimchi they also have the fresh bakery there with all kinds of breads they have a juice station  and then they also have like cereal fruits even small sushi selection the breakfast normally  cost about it equates to US about $38 but if you have the diamond status or gold status you do  get two complimentary breakfasts per morning here in the restaurant which is just stunning you  also can elect to have breakfast in the club lounge if you\u0027d prefer to have it there their  executive club if you\u0027re a diamond member stay tuned because I will show you what that breakfast  buffet looks like it\u0027s a little bit on the smaller side but it\u0027s a little bit more exclusive but  I always prefer to have breakfast here in the main restaurant here\u0027s a quick look here at the  noodle station i always love having noodle soup for breakfast but everything tasted really good  it was very relaxed atmosphere and service was fantastic they even had special branded little wet  wipes which were really unique now we\u0027re going to head back around here on that same floor there\u0027s  a quick look at the beautiful spiral staircase it actually goes pretty high up like it is a  beautiful engineering marvel that they put this in here and it just fits so nicely in with the design  of the hotel now this is the Atrio restaurant on the same floor here it was closed at the time when  I took this video but this is more of an Italian restaurant specializing in special pasta dishes  it looks very nice so if we go back I definitely would want to check it out next up we\u0027re going  to go up to the 37th floor because this is where their grill and bar is as well as the executive  lounges they\u0027re both located on the same floor so straight ahead is the 37 grill and bar it\u0027s  somewhat like a steakhouse i believe they have a beautiful bar area here as well as seating areas  they specialize in prime USDA steaks Australian Wagu and lobster and Chilean sea bass they also  have a lot of different wines and specialty items now around the corner here we have the executive  lounge now this is absolutely stunning it is just beautifully designed all the different details the  lighting fixtures everything about this place just felt wow and it was absolutely stunning service  was also very good they check you in as only Diamond members get access or you can pay an extra  fee to have it this is the breakfast buffet so if you don\u0027t want to go to the main restaurant you  can just decide to have it here instead it\u0027s a lot smaller of a selection but people like it because  they say it\u0027s a little bit more private it\u0027s more quiet you can just kind of relax i\u0027m sure too  like if you\u0027re here for a week being down in the big buffet it could get a little loud at times so  you might want to just come up here for a couple days to just get breakfast here it\u0027s a little bit  more quiet more relaxed and they have quite a few really good options that I enjoyed but of course  the main buffet is always my preference in the Zest restaurant as they just have the limited  selection but everything is beautifully placed here in the lounge they also have a whole drink  selection and then they even have a separate area with a different room which has more seating areas  but just really beautiful they also have some alcoholic beverages that are included with the  lounge here\u0027s a quick look at the evening orves which they put out in the afternoon and evening  they also have some drinks then and then they even brought us some specialty little drinks  service was absolutely excellent and it also offers some incredible views of the city towering  over there by the river and the other buildings it\u0027s just a really unique design i love the  shape of the curtains everyone was very friendly and then there\u0027s those special drinks that they  brought us they also had some special like yuzu honey tea one of the coolest things is on the same  level here which is the executive lounge and the grill bathrooms it\u0027s one of the coolest bathrooms  I\u0027ve ever seen each one is completely private and when you walk in it\u0027s almost like your own little  zen garden we have a really cool wash basin we have really cool like lighting and those  plants definitely like the coolest club lounge or restaurant bathroom I\u0027ve ever seen in my life  now this is a very special rooftop garden bar it\u0027s called Vertigo and it\u0027s one of the best features  of the hotel but is often overlooked because it\u0027s kind of hidden and not everyone knows about it  but it\u0027s really beautiful because it\u0027s like on the rooftop in between the tall buildings so it\u0027s  just a really unique feel they have some like kind of turf like imitation grass on the roof but it\u0027s  a very high-end feeling and design and then they offer some lunch options and dinner options some  small plates and a lot of different drinks they also have fusion style tapas and sliders they have  sometimes a live DJ some nights and sometimes some seasonal events but it definitely looks like a  place to enjoy if I ever make it back we were just here one quick night so we did not have time to  enjoy all the different venues that the property offers now this is the little 10g it\u0027s called  their grab-and-go cafe and this is in the lobby they have pastries desserts sandwiches salads  cold brews lattes and teas okay so this part of the hotel is something I wasn\u0027t expecting to love  as much but the Conrad Soul Spa and Wellness Area it\u0027s genuinely one of the best urban spa settings  I\u0027ve seen the spa is not just a hotel add-on but it\u0027s actually a standalone luxury destination spa  that people come to use that aren\u0027t even hotel guests there also is that really cool golf studio  in the building now the spa area is spread across the eighth and 9th floor with a that private  elevators here to take you to the different levels you just check in and as long as you\u0027re a  hotel guest you get access to the changing rooms pool and the fitness center this here is heading  into the pool on the way in they have all kinds of lockers they also have the slides that you can  slip on before going into the pool there is a pool attendant to help you get situated which I really  appreciated and then right next door there by the lockers they have a men\u0027s and women\u0027s small area  with a couple showers additional lockers inside but really like the design now keep in mind if  you are traveling to Korea every single pool you will need to wear a swim cap and if you don\u0027t  have one with you the Conrad will sell you one there but it was about $12 which is kind of not  that great it should definitely be included for hotel guests because of the high price of the  rooms but it is not so definitely bring it in there the pool area was nice it\u0027s just a kind of  a long lap pool but the design was very beautiful here\u0027s the state-of-the-art fitness center it is  gigantic they have every type of equipment and it kind of looks into the pool area very spacious  it felt very modern clean and I really enjoyed using it especially the treadmills the hotel  is connected directly to the IFC mall so from the hotel you can walk right into the mall they  have a lot of nice shopping areas it\u0027s really convenient if you need to buy anything but  also just gives you something to do the mall is extremely modern they even have a Starbucks  reserve lots of different restaurants like Shake Shack so if you don\u0027t want to eat necessarily in  the hotel you can always go to the IFC Mall it\u0027s three stories and it\u0027s a huge shopping complex  it\u0027s part of the larger international finance center soul development so it\u0027s attached to  three skyscrapers a cinema a massive office park and of course the hotel okay now for the  review of the Conrad Soul so like I mentioned this is my first Hilton hotel review I am doing  we are also very fortunate to have diamond status with Hilton so that\u0027s how we got this upgrade to  this really cool corner room it\u0027s a premium room my one thing though is even for diamond members  which is the highest level you can get with Hilton at this specific property they don\u0027t do any  free upgrades to any suites at all so that\u0027s a little bit disappointing i think they should  at least allow diamond members to get at least a basic suite but otherwise the hotel is still just  incredible so I want to start with the room room five out of five for being 12 years old this room  it still feels basically like new a lot of the hallways the areas it just reminds me a lot of the  Ritz Carlton Kyoto that property is also about the same age but it\u0027s almost like timeless same with  this like all the different wood designs in the room still the carpeting the beds everything here  is just incredible it\u0027s so beautiful it\u0027s so clean modern still i love this room it\u0027s so comfortable  you have all the amenities there with the kettle the coffee the nice robes the beautiful rainfall  shower automatic curtains that are true blackout just gorgeous views here there\u0027s only about 36  guest room floors and we\u0027re on level 35 so this is about as high as it gets the only level higher is  the 37th floor which is where the club lounges the executive lounge and diamond members do get access  to that which is very nice as well as uh they have a nice restaurant and bar up there too but this  basically as high as it gets some of the most incredible views i was just looking out the window  at night at the skyline from both directions just insane next up Inspiration 5 out of five this  hotel has blown me away it\u0027s right up there with the top city hotels in the world the huge high  ceilings in the lobby the spiral staircase every elevator bay just the lighting is so sophisticated  the hallways the lighting is so sophisticated they spared no expense on the design and build of this  property the pool the fitness center every single public area even the rooms it\u0027s just flawless  i\u0027ve just been blown away with inspiration even the breakfast area is just so beautiful next up is  going to be service service we\u0027re going to give a five out of five excellent service we checked in  they were so kind we got right away check-in they also have been very friendly all around every  person that we\u0027ve met we haven\u0027t really met any employees that have not been accommodating the  only areas for improvement breakfast service was great i feel like they just could have checked in  on us a little bit more also when we arrived there was someone there to help us with our luggage  unloading it from our vehicle but I feel like just because this hotel has so many rooms over 400  I think they need even more valet staff out front just because sometimes it can get really busy with  a lot of cars and sometimes it can take them a little while to get to everyone but otherwise for  us it was still just incredible service everyone is so friendly kind just really amazing finally  value would I return five out of five i can\u0027t wait to come back here if I\u0027m in Seoul i\u0027m definitely  going to stay back here at least tonight again just gorgeous property i love it it\u0027s also a great  redemption if you have the Hilton honors points this night was only 70,000 points so I value  Hilton points at a little bit lesser value than Marriott points so Marriott points I value out  about a penny a piece these ones are maybe like half that to 75 of a cent a piece so it\u0027s still a  good value here but the normal pricing is going to be be about $350 300,400 just for a standard room  here per night which is still a little expensive but it is so worth it and includes like the pool  the fitness center everything is just so flawless but overall perfect score this is only the first  hotel out of five we\u0027re doing in Korea so let\u0027s go check out the next one we\u0027ll see how they  all the future ones compare to this amazing one"}
{"video_id":"4oag5k0bnkc","lang":"en","full_text":"forget about the oldest hotel in Korea. These days, the Westin Chosun Seoul, the flagship of the Shinsegae Chosun Hotel, famous for its cost-effectiveness, is so noteworthy. Let\u0027s find out today with \"Leaving Again\" whether it is still well-maintained. [Music] Uh, hello again, I\u0027m a man. I\u0027m Leaving Again. The first hotel in Korea opened in the 1880s at Jemulpo Port in Incheon. It was the Terry. Hotels targeting foreigners were built in Seoul and Incheon, but there are almost none left. These days, the oldest hotel in Korea, the Westin Chosun Seoul, still exists, even though it was built in 1914 by the Japanese Government-General of Korea\u0027s Railway Bureau. It is operated as the Westin Chosun Seoul. When it was first established, it was a four-story building with a land area of ​​6,700 pyeong and 60 guest rooms. After liberation, the Chosun Hotel was taken over by the South Korean government. In 1967, it signed a contract with Enamel Camera Line for the construction of a new hotel, and in 1970, it reopened as a hostel in its current form. In fact, the hotel building we are currently using is about 50 years old.  You can think of it as having passed. After the reopening, the hotel\u0027s shares went to the Westin Hotel and Samsung 9th Floor. In 1992, when Shinsegae became independent from Samsung, it acquired the Westin\u0027s shares, and in 1995, it acquired the roof that held the Westin 5th Floor. Currently, the hotel is 100% operated by the Shinsegae Chosun Hotel. You might be wondering how the 5th Floor, which has a history of over 100 years and was built over 50 years ago, is maintained. When you actually enter the hotel, you don\u0027t feel much of the passage of time. Of course, it is low because of the characteristics of an old building, but the bright marble floor and dark pillars give it a sense of being organized. In addition, thanks to the luxurious interior that feels heavy, the Robin Hood\u0027s guest rooms feel more central. When you move to the guest rooms, you feel a bit more of the passage of time than the lobby. It doesn\u0027t feel poorly maintained at all. It seems that it is an unavoidable part because the interior is from that era, not a modern feel. Esteem Chosun Seoul has standard rooms and suites. The Deluxe Waikiki Executive Room is the most basic room, and all Executive Rooms and above are available.  The room I\u0027m showing you today is the Executive Suite, which is the most luxurious room, except for the two types of suites that are overflowing with water. Upon entering the room, the living room is centered on the wall with a full-length mirror, and the bedroom is on the right, completely separating the space. This bright wood wall, which is often seen at the Westin Chosun Seoul, seems to be a problem, similar to the molding of an old apartment, but I didn\u0027t like it because it felt a bit too mixed. However, once you move inside, you see a living room that is wider and more beautiful than you thought. And above all, the highlight is the window where Hwangudan looks deserted. Hwangudan was built in 1897 by a foundation company to perform a ceremony when King Gojong of Joseon ascended to the throne as the emperor of the Korean Empire. At that time, only Heungbu Bay in the middle of the Hwangudan annex remains, and you can see it through the guest room window. The Westin Chosun Seoul, which stands in a triangle shape in the middle of the city, has three reviews, but the direction facing Hwangungu is the most popular. In particular, Hwanggomo is located on a very high floor, so unlike other hotels, rooms on lower floors are preferred.  This is a more popular and unusual case. In addition to the Hwangudan B, there is a view toward Myeongdong with the back of Lotte Department Store visible, and a view toward Park Chang with the Bank of Korea and the old Motol construction site visible, but neither view is particularly impressive. The living room is large enough to accommodate a guest room, but it is a bit dark because it is filled with natural experiences and world-class stand lights. The brown and beige carpets match this atmosphere, and the Gago side is decorated in tone-on-tone to create a soft and stable atmosphere. As expected from a famous business hotel, the space is spacious and well- equipped. The guest room is old, but it has the latest touch controller, so you can easily control things like the lighting and the room temperature. On the other side of the living room is the bedroom. It is a complete hotel room. It is a two- bedroom room, so there is one queen bed and one twin bed. It is a good size for families, and the back of Lotte Department Store is visible through the window. A friend told me about the mattress from Sim Earth and the Westin Chosun\u0027s famous Haeblip, but personally, I have heard good sleep when I go to the Westin Chosun. As it is a suite, there are two bathrooms. Although it feels a bit old, there is a reverse side, and the shower is not visible from the outside, and there is a fisherman\u0027s tea.  It\u0027s Jo Malone, and it\u0027s a 6-room suite with no particular drawbacks. The living room is decorated with artificial flowers, and it\u0027s quite large for a secondary bathroom. The only drawback is that there\u0027s only one sink in the main bathroom, but it\u0027s possible to do it yourself with a spacious secondary bathroom. The mini-fridge is under the TV in the living room. It\u0027s refreshing to see the coffee cups prepared like this. The wardrobe is at the bedroom entrance, and at first glance, I almost passed it by thinking it was just a wall. You might think it\u0027s neat and tidy for a 1950s-era Nortel, but you might wonder if it\u0027s worth going to a hotel that\u0027s been around for so long. In fact, the main reason I went to the Westin Seoul was to use the club lounge. The hotel includes lounge access for all rooms except for the executive rooms, and the Westin Executive Club Lounge is located on the 20th floor. It\u0027s a building that feels like it\u0027s been built to match the overall atmosphere of the hotel, but it has a bright feel with the study and orchids here and there. The food is a breakfast staple and a sewing kit for the pre-recorded terror, and light refreshments are provided at other times. There\u0027s no separate afternoon tea time, so I thought there would be virtually nothing to eat before happy hour, but when I actually went there,  There was a variety of desserts prepared, just like a lounge that offers afternoon tea. There were cookies, egg tarts, colorful cookies, macarons, and coconut tarts all day long. Coffee and Ronnefeldt tea were available for drinks. I unexpectedly ate my fill of desserts. Pacquiao had a one-hour usage limit, but due to the large number of guests, I was able to use it in my room after about 20 minutes. There was salmon, grilled salmon, chicken breast, seafood, all kinds of dances, and Joseon\u0027s Zara Matthew Brie. There were wine snacks such as Sejong\u0027s I\u0027ll and cheese. There were two types of wine, red and white wine, one type of sparkling wine, and eight types of liquor. There were only five types of menu, but the bar was good, so I was full quickly. If you think you should eat as extravagantly as at a hotel buffet, it might be a pity, but if you think about it as a person who eats frugally, and considering the low price compared to the tower, it was okay. I think breakfast was also in the lounge.  It is provided, and on the day I used it, my lover\u0027s breakfast buffet for two was served at Aria. Recently, when I stayed at the Westin Chosun Busan, I also used the main buffet Camellia, but I\u0027ve been lucky these days. Located on the first floor below the lobby, BP is not far from Las, and along with the class, it is known as one of the top three buffets in Seoul, so the food is excellent in both taste and composition. I\u0027ve tried all of them, including Grand Josun Busan, Jeju, and Aria, but I\u0027ve never been disappointed because it fits my mouth perfectly every time. In addition, there are many popular restaurants in Seoul. The famous Chinese restaurant Hongyeon Hotel, which also opened a branch of Chosun Penis, is famous for its 3 o\u0027clock name and Sushijo, and there is also the Italian osteria in Love Dika, the American contemporary restaurant and bar Rice Gate, and the summer watermelon lounge and bar, and the delicious restaurant Chosun Doeni. There are quite a few people who visit the Westin Chosun Seoul to use the food and beverage outlets even if they are not staying at the hotel. The hotel\u0027s auxiliary facilities include the CTS Naeri Club, which has a swimming pool and fitness center.  The Westin Chosun Busan MHS Red Club was fun. The gym was filled with Life Fitness equipment. Maybe it was because I didn\u0027t expect much from an older hotel, but it was surprisingly good. The city view from the window was charming, and the size was large. The equipment was n\u0027t the latest, but it was quite varied, making it enjoyable to work out. The pool had an impressive, well-lit ceiling. It was conveniently divided into sections, but I might have to squeeze in a little water play. However, you can only use the gym and pool once during your stay. If you want to use both, you have to pass and stick to a schedule that\u0027s a bit too much for a beard straightener. So, what\u0027s your overall review of the Westin Chosun Seoul? The lounge is definitely worth it if you book on a special price. Considering its long history, it\u0027s well-maintained, but it\u0027s not a hotel that\u0027s just plain boring. It\u0027s a decent hotel that offers good value for money, so I thoughtlessly used the food. The chicken lounge food and rooms aren\u0027t the best, so I\u0027m not a weakling in the rooms. This is important. The Westin Chosun Seoul has recently become so popular that it\u0027s so easy to find special offers on various platforms or credit card events. It\u0027s a real shame to pay full price for it. I usually show you basic rooms when I review them, but today, I showed you the Executive Suite because it was so special that it was possible to talk about it. If you make a reservation for a standard executive room in the early to mid 200,000 won range, it\u0027s a hotel where you can eat and rest at a good price. Although it\u0027s the main branch of the Shinsegae Chosun Hotel, it\u0027s not at all comparable to nearby Lotte Department Stores or Shilla Hotel Season 3 due to our unavoidable acquaintances. I recommend that you go there thinking that you\u0027re enjoying a 5-2 vacation at a hotel with a long history and class. If you found the original shape interesting and helpful, please subscribe, like, and set notifications. Next time, I\u0027ll come back with a review of the Sofitel Ambassador Seoul, the hottest hotel these days, which gives you a quick and emotional feeling in Jamsil. Then, I\u0027ve been a man who leaves and leaves again. Thank you."}
{"video_id":"bWgiXHCP83E","lang":"en","full_text":"Namsan\u0027s old-timer, trendy, Seoul Amcham, and Han River are all within the hotel. Let\u0027s find out what the cheapest bar is among them. [Music] Hello, this is Nam, who gives birth again. Grand Act 4 is one of the oldest hotels in Korea. It opened in 1978 and has stood tall on Namsan for over 40 years. It has been one of the representative hotels in Seoul with a long history, and in fact, the PlayStation Suite on the 10th floor is famous for having been stayed at weddings by American presidents and British royalty. It is said to be optimized for cases where it is surrounded by Namsan and there are no tall buildings nearby. Until recently, it was the only hotel in the Asia Pacific region that Hyatt headquarters owned 100% of the land. We are Ahyat. There are a total of 5 hotels. Anyway, if you look at the ratings from the inside, the Paka Et Seoul in Samseong Station is the highest category, and the Paka Et Busan with a view of Gwangan Bridge is the highest category.  Grand Art Seoul in Namsan and Grand Art Jeju, which recently opened in Jeju City, are category 4. Lastly, the one in Incheon is category 1, 3. Grand Hyatt Seoul has six types of rooms. The most basic room is the Standard Room. The Premium Corner Room, which is the same as the Standard Room but is located on the 5th floor and offers a choice of views. There are also two types of suites. The room I stayed in was the cheapest, the Standard Room, and it was located on the 12th floor. Usually, only one side of the building has a nice view, but Grand Hyatt Seoul has a nice view on both sides of the building thanks to its location. One side has the Han River view and the other side has Namsan. The view is actually a matter of taste, so it\u0027s hard to say which is better. Of course, you might think that the Han River view from the river view side is better, but the Namsan view is not to be ignored. If you go to the Shilla Hotel, you might fly to stay in the Namsan Biyu room. The price is a little more expensive. Anyway, the view is a matter of taste, but in the case of the Standard Room, it\u0027s quiet.  You can\u0027t choose a view. Of course, you can leave a note with your preferred view when making a reservation. In my case, since I stayed on my birthday, I asked for a room with a view of the Han River, which is the most popular among customers, as a birthday present. Of course, they gave me a birthday present without any reason. I was guided to a room with a view of the Han River on the 12th floor, the highest floor of the standard room. I checked in right away. It\u0027s a bit far from the Han River to call it a Han River view. It\u0027s more like a Hannam-dong view with a Han River view. However, I could see a review from afar, and the ice rink was still in operation when I visited, so I personally really liked it. In the summer, you can see the outdoor pool in the same spot as R3. The room size is 30 square meters, which is smaller than the Gibong room at the same hotel in Saul. However, because the hotel is located on a high ground and one side has full-length windows, it didn\u0027t feel particularly stuffy or cramped. There was a king-size bed. The room interior had a large, bright wood paneling and gray-toned ink paintings, creating an oriental feel. If the Four Seasons room had the feel of a Joseon Dynasty royal palace, it would have been better.  The rooms have a temple or villa feel. Perhaps because the rooms are narrow, the rock side feels more spacious than the other side. There is a sofa and a round table that can be pulled out for a moment to enjoy the beautiful view. Beyond the lattice-patterned translucent window is a bathroom, which fortunately can be completely blocked off from the bedroom with blinds. Although the room is a bit narrow, it doesn\u0027t feel stuffy. However, the bathroom felt really small. If you sit at the sink, you might feel like you\u0027re touching the toilet. And there is no toilet nb. Only the standard room doesn\u0027t have a bidet. It\u0027s understandable to differentiate between rooms, but I wonder if it\u0027s really necessary to make such a difference. The sink is just neat and the amenities are Balmain products. In fact, except for the 11th floor, the standard rooms on all floors have a bathtub instead of a shower booth. When you first check in, they ask if it\u0027s okay to have a room without a bathtub, but it\u0027s a hundred times better. Because the rooms with a reverse side have not been remodeled, and all the remodeled rooms have a shower booth instead of a bathtub. The bathrooms before remodeling felt very old-fashioned. If possible, I recommend a room without a bathtub.  It\u0027s better to receive it. There\u0027s a mini bar near the entrance, and there\u0027s a 2L bottle of mineral water. I remember laughing when I first saw it and thinking, \"What is this?\" It\u0027s better to give a lot than to give it to me to drink. There\u0027s Nespresso capsule coffee, and the selection is somewhat weaker than in other hotels of the same class. The teacups are Hannam porcelain, and the water cups are German Schott Zweiser products. The room I\u0027ve shown you so far is the cheapest standard room in Seoul. However, it was on the 12th floor, the highest floor among the standard rooms, and the bathroom was also remodeled, so it can be considered the best room among the standard rooms. In fact, there\u0027s not much difference between the 13th floor Premier room and the 12th floor Standard room, as there\u0027s only a one-floor difference, so in a way, it can be considered the room with the best cost-effectiveness. However, since you can\u0027t choose the view or floor in the standard room, you have to be really lucky, like me, to get assigned to the 12th floor on your birthday. I really like TV1 Lee Law, so I stayed at the Grand Hyatt for my birthday. I really liked the Q, so I was very satisfied. The room rate  It was such a nice hotel, but I didn\u0027t want to waste time going to breakfast, so I ordered room service. After my hair was dry, I enjoyed the food in the warm sunlight. The service was so delicious. Even though I\u0027m the oldest Airtel in Korea, over 40 years old, I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s because they\u0027ve remodeled it several times, but from the servants to the hallway, it felt more luxurious than anything else. The entire hotel was not exactly a 10D, but it overflowed with luxury, making me think that it wasn\u0027t called the king of Namsan for nothing. Nevertheless, it\u0027s older than other hotels in the same class, and competition among hotels is fierce, so the price range has come down a lot compared to the past. It\u0027s a bit early for a standard room in Eunpyeong, but recently, you can stay for around 200,000 won. There are a few downsides, but they come with unexpected costs. It\u0027s the first time I\u0027ve seen a 5-star hotel charge a parking fee, and it\u0027s the first time I\u0027ve seen an Opel charge a fee for tableware like wine glasses or cutlery. It seems like various policies have changed since Opel was sold to a foreign private equity fund in 2019, but it\u0027s an unfamiliar policy that doesn\u0027t fit the hotel\u0027s class. However, personally,  I think it\u0027s the perfect place to visit for anniversaries or events, and although it\u0027s in the middle of nowhere, I personally liked the training because I could relax thanks to Namsan. Next time, the Shilla Hotel\u0027s April review, which says it\u0027ll give you 4 pops for the weak points of the rooms across from Namsan, will be posted. If you\u0027re interested in using steamed buns or traveling, please subscribe, like, and set up notifications. Then, I\u0027ve been a man for a while now, and I\u0027m grateful. [Music] Again"}

{"video_id":"9kFaoQtvD6I","lang":"en-US","full_text":"Welcome to the most luxurious hotel in  South Korea, The Four Seasons in Seoul. This hotel is located in the heart of  the business district here in Seoul, and is built like an ancient Korean palace.  It is a mixture of traditional and modern and widely regarded in the best hotel in all of  South Korea; so of course I did a full review. I review hotels all over the world out of  50 points in 5 categories. The categories, as always, are: The Ambiance, The Room, The  Dining, The Service, and The It-Factor. I\u0027m not sponsored by the hotel, this is just a review  of a guest staying here and paying full price. This is the grand lobby, centered  around this fireplace that has a map of Korea cast into the bronze below it. Right behind me is the reception and the check-in desk, which is always very staffed and  very fast. We\u0027ll take a look at the service a little bit later, but let me tell you right now,  you\u0027re going to be surprised. Also in the Four Seasons is the Nicolai Bergmann celebrity flower  shop. This is literally connected to the lobby, and they have incredible displays and really  really amazing bouquets that they built here. And once you\u0027re done getting flowers for that special  someone, you can come right here on site and get a clean shave with complimentary whiskey. OK, I was  clean shaven before, but you get the idea. So this is the vitality pool here, and it has a full juice  bar right next to it, you can literally swim up, come inside, enjoy a juice, and then get into  the gym. So they have a fully nude spa here at the Four Seasons, which is very traditional.  So I booked the Korean Body Scrub, which I\u0027m a little hesitant, but I\u0027m excited to try it. So I can\u0027t bring a camera into the scrub, but this is a very cool Korean spa. Wish me luck. That was absolutely incredible. He took a coarse towel, and almost angrily scrubbed my entire  body. I could tell he\u0027s done it a million times, so... wow, what an incredible treatment. So our wellness journey continues here in the gym, where they have Pilates reformers, a ton of  Technogym and modern equipment in there, and, in the locker room they give you Four Seasons  branded clothes to work out in. Like look at this: everything is dark leather. So it\u0027s brown leather  on all of the equipment, with the black contrast. Tons of equipment and all of it is modern like  it\u0027s brand new. What better way to end your day than with the golf simulator right here at  the Four Seasons. This is complimentary in your stay and they have 3D renderings of the top  courses from around the world. You can see there is so much to do here, you almost don\u0027t have to  leave this hotel. However, at other properties we\u0027ve seen the Ambiance just be a little bit  more unique, so I gave the Ambiance an 8/10. Now it\u0027s time to take a look at the Room. This is the standard room at the Four Seasons Seoul. There are 317 rooms here, in 16 different  categories. We\u0027re actually going to show you the top suite here in just a second, but  first I want to show you the standard. This is a modern take on traditional Korean decor  and design. So you can see there\u0027s some Korean integration into the room, you\u0027ve got the iconic  Four Seasons beds here which are the best sleep on this channel so far. Of course, Im going to do  a full bed review after sleeping on it tonight, but I\u0027m expecting it to be fantastic, like all  Four Seasons beds are. And it\u0027s pretty easy to see, even in the standard room, these are the  largest and some of the best, if not the best, hotel rooms in South Korea. You can see right  away the lighting is really thoughtful, all of the outlets and charging ports and lighting controls  and curtain controls are automated, and very easy to use. And, they give you a complimentary  tea set, some high end teas here, a tea kettle, a Nespresso machine -- everything is pristinely  clean. I mean, you cannot see a spec of dust or dirt, nothing is dirty. The housekeeping staff is  incredible. The Four Seasons hotel has been around for almost ten years now, as of the recording of  this video, and everything still feels very new. In some of these drawers, you have really nice  high-end, this is Louis Lavazza espresso pods, which is the highest end I\u0027ve ever seen at a  hotel. Very premium, very expensive. That\u0027s one thing to note about the Four Seasons, everything  in the mini-bar, everything in the hotel, is Four Seasons pricing, so keep that in mind.  And as of the recording of this video, this room for example goes anywhere between $600 - $1,000  per night. Now let\u0027s take a look at the bathroom. So for a standard room, this is a very spacious  bathroom. In fact, it looks out into the room, so you have a sliding door, while still  having a view of the city. Very modern, you have granite but it\u0027s not overly done.  It\u0027s a nice mixture of different textures, and different types of materials that they use in  this room in general, and in all of the rooms at the Four Seasons which I really like. You\u0027ve got  a modern, Japanese toilet, which is very common in South Korea in general. I\u0027m going to test the  shower now. So remember the shower is based on three criteria points: that is the Size, Ease  of use, and the Pressure. Let\u0027s give it a test. You push the button for the rain shower, which is  the easiest usage of a shower I have ever seen in a hotel review. Truly just pushing a button to  turn the shower on and off. If you want to turn this on, push the button. Ease of use, very high  for the shower. Let\u0027s test the pressure. For a rain shower, it\u0027s very consistent, extraordinarily  clean. You can see up there that there\u0027s no hard water build up, there\u0027s nothing there like  grime or dirt, someone is going up there and wiping that down in between every single stay,  guaranteed. The temperature control: very simple. And the size is excellent for a base level room.  Overall, this shower gets my stamp of approval. So I put on the robe in the room that they provide  for you, I\u0027m going to sleep in this bed tonight, and then give it a full review in the  morning. If you\u0027ve seen my reviews of other Four Seasons hotels, I think it\u0027s  going to be a really great night\u0027s sleep. Wow. The Four Seasons beds are absolutely  legendary. I have this bed in my own home. It felt like I was sleeping at home, but it\u0027s even nicer  when you\u0027re on a trip. Let\u0027s get dressed now, and I\u0027m going to show you the penthouse suite. As promised, here we are in the Presidential Suite at the Four Seasons in Seoul. With that  sweeping panoramic view of Seoul here, now this room is over $10,000 a night, even more than  that on some nights depending on when you book. But, really Four Seasons suites are some of the  best in the world, and this definitely is not an exception to that. There is literally nothing  negative I could say about this room. But let\u0027s go back to that base room and give it a score. So when I give the Room a score, I\u0027m considering all of the categories and some of the things  that are consistent across the rooms. The Four Season rooms are truly stunning across the world.  The design, the decor, the lighting, the modern touches, the incorporation of the traditional  Korean art and Korean ceremonies like this tea set that they give you, into the modern technological  advances that Four Seasons is known for is really done beautifully at this hotel. That Presidential  Suite is next level, although very expensive, and even the standard base room is very very  well done. What this room didn\u0027t have, however, was some of the extra extra things that take it  to the next level. Like a private plunge pool or a balcony overlooking the city. We\u0027ve seen things  like that at other hotels like the Ritz-Carlton Dorado Beach in their standard rooms. Overall  though, the rooms here are really spectacular, they are done beautifully and it\u0027s very thoughtful  how they put it together. I gave the Room Score at the Four Seasons in Seoul, an 8/10. There are eight restaurants and bars here at the Four Seasons. We\u0027re gonna look at all  of them, and give it a final score at the end. So this is the Market Kitchen, which is a buffet  style breakfast, lunch, and dinner. It is truly incredible in here. On this side, you have a  full pastry kitchen with desserts and cakes, it\u0027s all included. You have lobster, sushi, you  have high-end rolls, you\u0027ve got chefs making noodles, Korean dishes, breakfast here, I mean  really really exceptional buffet. Let\u0027s give it a try. Everything here looks so perfect, I feel like  I don\u0027t even wanna touch it. Like these little ice cream cones, maybe the best buffet I\u0027ve ever seen. This chocolate fountain is actually made out of 24 Karat gold, with a train with a Four Seasons  logo on the top of the train. So over here is the more traditional Korean dishes. Little  bit of beef tartar, stir fried dried anchovies, scallops in the half shell, snow crab  legs -- look at this -- baby octopus soup, pickled dragon fruit. I\u0027m having a great time.  With our full plates, let\u0027s give it a try. Very good, and the good news is, at the Market  if there\u0027s something that you didn\u0027t like, there\u0027s about a thousand other options of things  that you could eat for breakfast here. Wow, that is very fresh. Overall The Market is a  very impressive start to the food here at the Four Seasons Seoul. This is Confections, it is  right next to the main lobby. They have a full tea setup, a coffee offering, they have pastries  and different bakery items. The pastries in South Korea are truly unbelievable. If you didn\u0027t  know that, just do a quick Google search of the pastries in South Korea. It\u0027s exceptional.  So we\u0027ve got the winter cube, everything is made in-house here at the confectionery.  Let\u0027s see if it\u0027s as good as it looks. I didn\u0027t know with the presentation if it was  gonna be as good as it is. So light, so fresh, very very very good. Another thing Korea\u0027s is  known for is their croissants, which is kind-of funny you wouldn\u0027t think that. Let\u0027s try it. Not the  best croissant that I\u0027ve had in Korea. A little dry, but that winter cube is extraordinarily  good. Hello from Boccalino; this is the Italian restaurant here at the property. Look at  this, it\u0027s a pistachio mortadella pizza, the most popular thing on the menu here at Boccalino.  Let\u0027s give it a try. Wow, I don\u0027t even know how to explain that. The meat the mortadella are cold,  the pizza is hot, and the pistachio is crunchy. So it\u0027s a mixture of temperatures and flavors  and textures. Wow! That\u0027s really interesting. Right in the center of the hotel is Maru,  it is light snacks, a light dinner, tea, coffee. It\u0027s kind of a perfect central place in  the hotel for people to gather and grab some food. So let\u0027s try their menu. Look at this burger.  We\u0027ve had some good burgers on this channel, but that looks like it might take it. Mmmm.  It\u0027s not the best I\u0027ve ever had on this channel, but, this is definitely a contender. Wow. This is Akira Back, it is a Japanese and Korean fusion restaurant for dinner here. They  have something on the menu called the Chef\u0027s Mystery Box. So all we ordered tonight is the  Chef\u0027s Mystery Box. Let\u0027s see what\u0027s inside. Look at this here. This is the Chef\u0027s Mystery  Box, it\u0027s nine different mini courses. No idea what is in it. Let\u0027s give it a try. Truly some of the best sashimi I have ever had. Multiple dinner venues here at the Four  Seasons, and one of them is Yu Yuan; a Cantonese dining experience with  Beijing Duck as the famous dish tonight. Wow. That is an interesting mix of flavor.  You have a sweet soy sauce, vegetables, and then of course the Beijing Duck. All wrapped  for you. But wow. Yeah, I can see why that is their signature dish here. Wow. So after those incredible meals, the first of  the two bars here is called OUL. And they have something tonight called the K-Gourmet tasting  flight. So it\u0027s three different cocktails that are traditional Korean cocktails. We\u0027re gonna give  those a try, and then I\u0027m going to show you the hidden bar here at the Four Seasons. The first  drink here in our flight is acacia gin with lime and honey. Not my favorite, I\u0027m not a big gin fan,  but it\u0027s good. The second in the flight is the garlic ginger mule. Wow. Oh that\u0027s my favorite.  The third and final cocktail here is a soju base with fermented rice and milk in the drink itself.  You can see these little rice kernels on top. That is a really strange - it\u0027s very viscous, it\u0027s like  a thick syrup. Absolutely amazing. So this bar is the more traditional Korean drinks, but downstairs  there\u0027s a hidden bar that you can only find if you know where the entrance is. So on the side of the  lobby here downstairs there\u0027s this non-descript door, which is actually a legendary speakeasy  here in the Four Seasons. Let\u0027s take a look. Wow. This is Charles H, a speakeasy in the Four Seasons in Seoul. We\u0027re  about to actually meet the head bartender here who designed the entire menu, his name  is Odd, he comes all the way from Norway. My name is Odd Strandbakken, I\u0027m the head  bartender for Charles H here in Four Seasons Seoul, but also the Beverage Ambassador for  Northern Asia. Come to South Korea, it\u0027s the most fun place in the world. But come with an  open mind, try all of the amazing food - it\u0027s really rooted in a long tradition. Gorgeous  food, gorgeous people, good time to be here. Wow. So those were the dining options here  at the Four Seasons in Seoul. I have never on this channel had such a wide range and  diversity of different culinary experiences, and almost every single dish that we had at every  restaurant was extraordinary and definitely worth coming back for. You could stay here for 30 days  straight and try something new every single day, which is a huge factor in the Dining Score. There  were only a couple of dishes that maybe felt like they were slightly off, or I personally didn\u0027t  like the flavor of. And maybe the croissants and bakery items like the pastries that they  have, could be improved slightly. But we are talking minimal, minimal changes. And that\u0027s  why I am pleased to tell you that the Dining here at the Four Seasons is a very high 9/10. So the Service here at the Four Seasons Seoul has truly been some of the best I\u0027ve  ever experienced anywhere in the world, let alone here in South Korea. The service in  Korea as a whole is very attentive, very hands-on, but at other hotels like The Signiel that we\u0027ve  reviewed, we noticed that they won\u0027t really step out of line very much, they won\u0027t do anything that  isn\u0027t by standard hotel protocol. Let\u0027s see if the Four Seasons will do something a little bit more  interesting here with The Service Test. The Four Seasons website says they \"Can Arrange Virtually  Almost Anything\", so I want to see if that\u0027s true. Hi there, I have a request for you. I  would like to request if you are able to basically make the room like a tent setup,  and like, I think you have like fake candles potentially. Is there anything like that? Yes, the, like, setting up a tent in the room, as if we were making like a  pillow fort, or a bed tent. Alright excellent, that sounds perfect. Bye bye. Alright, let\u0027s see what they  set up and how it looks. Alright it\u0027s been a couple hours  now. What! That is amazing. Even better than expected! Unbelievable, I don\u0027t know who\u0027s going to sleep in this tent tonight, but  look at this, and there\u0027s a note here too. Wow. \"Welcome to Four Seasons Hotel Seoul\" Not only did they set up this whole tent, they gave me an eye mask to wear  if I were to sleep inside of it, and wrote me a custom note on the glass as well.  They absolutely passed the Service Test here, which has really been a testament to the  service overall at the hotel. I\u0027ve genuinely been blown away. It\u0027s very rare that in a review  I will give a super high score on the Service, I think it\u0027s one of the hardest things to  do for a hotel, especially one of this size, but the Four Seasons Seoul blew it out of the  park. Matter of fact, when I left here earlier, I had my laptop out, and they put a cleaning cloth  customized and branded Four Seasons right next to the laptop for me so I could wipe the screen down.  There\u0027s been multiple different amenities put out, different tea sets that they place for us,  different cookies for the turn down service. Generally speaking, it is one of the best service  experiences that I\u0027ve ever had. I gave it a 9/10. The hotel is located in the dead center of the  business district here and it\u0027s within walking distance of traditional villages, the temple, and  other really great sight seeing in the area. That really is getting into now the It-Factor. The  It-Factor is that thing about a hotel you can\u0027t really explain, but it makes you want to keep  coming back. So the Four Seasons here is actually built on top of an ancient street from the Josun  Dynasty, they\u0027ve preserved that street and in the basement of the hotel through the glass here, you  can actually see the original street, with some informational cards and some descriptions of what  you\u0027re looking at. An amazing feature to highlight the history of the hotel. So because we have seen  other properties that just have more of a tie-in to the place where they\u0027re located, or have  something more unique or interesting about the property, I gave the It-Factor a 6.5/10. So there you go. That is the Four Seasons here in Seoul, South Korea. I had an incredible time staying here  and highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a hotel in the city. It is unfortunately  time to check out and give it that final score out of 50 points. If you add everything together  throughout this review, I gave the Seoul South Korea Four Seasons a very high, if not one of  the highest on the channel so far, 40.5/50. Now if you\u0027re looking for  other hotels like this one, check out my review of the Four Seasons  Anguilla. Another hotel that was similar, but not a Four Seasons property, is the  Ritz-Carlton Dorado Beach in Puerto Rico. Thanks so much for watching, I\u0027m Ryan  Walker, and we\u0027ll see you on the next one."}

can\u0027t even get it all in one shot this is the Lotte World Tower but we\u0027re staying at the very tip in the signal hotel you know it\u0027s going to be nice when there\u0027s a rolls-royce parked outside the front I believe that you can use that for an airport transfer I hate to ask how much additional that would be anyway let\u0027s go straight inside and I\u0027ll give you a tour of what you get when you stay here [Music] let\u0027s go and check this out [Music] here we are in the lobby of you already from the lobby is absolutely ridiculous I mean I think the good thing is that because it\u0027s the lobby literally a sort of wraps around the whole building you can get a really interesting perspective of Seoul so the main part of the city is just over there this is the theme park I haven\u0027t yet gone and just to see buildings that would usually be really tall look so tiny they\u0027re dwarfed by this crazy building right so the room really key oh wow let\u0027s just firstly check out the state how nice is that but yeah what we\u0027ve all come for really is the view I\u0027ll get the lights off in a sec but oh my goodness so guys this is the 96th floor of the 6th tallest building in the world ok the real party piece of this though is to be able to sit in the bath and look at this view look at this so bathroom is just like a complete overkill of marble but I love it don\u0027t know what the amenities are let\u0027s have a look made in Italy unlikely something I\u0027ll ever be able to afford normally so we\u0027ll be using that I guess to apply my makeup good little view there lovely but I didn\u0027t even notice that as a shower in there right it\u0027s what I like I\u0027ll for God\u0027s sake of course a toilet just that what in the name I mean when have you opened a door of a bath and the toilet seats come up and then cleaned itself okay this is the controls for this now how when have you ever seen anything quite as mannered like I\u0027ve seen some crazy ones like in Japan and stuff but I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve seen something with this many options before I mean not quite sure about that I\u0027ve seen it all well until until we go in here this is quite frankly ridiculous the amount of Instagram photos I\u0027m going to attempt to get here honestly guys I\u0027ve stayed in some incredible places and I\u0027ve stayed in the world\u0027s tallest building but the issue with that is that you didn\u0027t actually stay at the top you stayed as you would have seen on the video on I think about the 9th or 10th floor I feel like this should be the new trendy YouTube office to be honest with you don\u0027t think I\u0027ll be able for the rent where you guys just gonna have to watch a ton more of the videos and you\u0027re gonna have to LIKE and subscribe if you haven\u0027t already I\u0027ve just been presented with my well curved rink which is like a Korean traditional tea and some cookies well try that out I\u0027m just about to go to sleep this bed by the way is so ridiculous but why I was gonna show you was the heat remote control that closes the curves I would love to have this at home these Kearns I mean I know it is totally lazy and totally unnecessary but he just feel like a heap like a rock star we got to close these curtains like this I am saying so sad I\u0027m all the guys in the left many many buttons 101 79 we\u0027re going to 81 for breakfast breakfast was phenomenal whilst a little busy there was a huge selection of high-quality delicious food and of course a hats a black of wind a see you\u0027re also able to order a la carte food and I went for the Eggs Benedict this was fantastic the staff were very attentive throughout the meal and kept providing me with additional coffee and water now let\u0027s check out yet another one of the signals Party Pieces starting in one of the world\u0027s highest changing rooms you can tell this is a slightly special experience the crowning jewel of course is the pool the pool itself was all well and good but it\u0027s the fact you\u0027re swimming 90 floors up why I\u0027d give a quick conclusion on my stay here because it\u0027s just been so unbelievable obviously you\u0027ve seen it in the day but just I mean clearly it\u0027s not quite in the same state that it was when I arrived but I just can\u0027t get over this like literally the views that you get very cool it\u0027s just unbelievable the bath and that this toilet still it\u0027s just so funny it keeps cleaning itself intermittently I\u0027m not complaining but living the dream yeah what about more bass than I\u0027ve ever had in my life here but you\u0027ve got to review like that so guys my experience of this hotel has I think surpassed pretty much any expectation that I had coming into this I read the reviews and they were like 5 out of 5 on TripAdvisor they were absolutely amazing but I have to say the experience has been unbelievable the staff have been amazing the rooms been very comfortable there\u0027s been a loads of additional services and amenities the spa has been wonderful although it was closed today once a month and it has to be good last overtime here - lie still we used it yesterday as you saw and I just think overall it\u0027s just such a surreal experience to be so high up above everyone else it\u0027s just crazy the 96th floor you I don\u0027t think I get used to it you think you would get used to it after I\u0027ve been here three days now but now still just as amazing each time that I see this view but quite given the title of the most ridiculous hotel in the world but it is one of the most ridiculous for sure I\u0027ve enjoyed this review guys do let me know what you think in the comments below and smash that subscribe button if you enjoyed it and you want to see more videos like this on the channel I\u0027ll catch you guys again very soon [Music]"}
{"video_id":"f9i9bQnBvFU","lang":"en","full_text":"Hello guys! welcome back to foo dojo In today’s video, I will be showing you guys  one of my favorite Hotel in Gangnam Seoul Korea The name of the hotel is voco hotel Seoul  Gangnam by InterContinental Hotels Group. Located in Seoul\u0027s lively Gangnam  district, which is brimming with exciting tourist attractions, and business centers. It is also known as one of the richest districts in South Korea and is home to many department  stores, underground shopping centers, and malls. This is where you would find Louis Vuitton,  Chanel, Versace, and other designer stores. The nearest tourist spots are Garosugil 0.3km, Hyundai Department Store 1.3km,  and Apgujeong Rodeo Street 1.7km. Now let’s go inside the hotel The lobby looks like this and there is a  restaurant behind the counter called Amarillo. Amarillo, their all-day dining  restaurant, serves international fusion cuisine for breakfast, lunch, and  dinner, as well as delightful cocktails. The check-in time is 3 pm but I was able to check  in at 11 am because of gold member benefits. You could also do an early check-in for a charge. Now let’s go to the room. We had to reserve two rooms for  this stay because it was full. But both of the room was on the 9th  floor so it was easy to switch rooms This is Our first room. a Premium One King Bed with Bathtub. This is a 30 square meters Premium room with  a king-size bed, city views, high-speed Wi-Fi, a complimentary Minibar, 55-inch smart TV,  and a bathroom with a rain shower and bathtub. From the window, you can see the main  street, Namsan Tower, and the river, You can also go to Garosugil in less  than 5 minutes so it was a great location The closet has bathrobes and slippers, There is a free mini bar in the room  where you can enjoy free crackers, drip coffee, hot chocolate, and tea in the refrigerator, there are also beer,  rice beer, water, sparkling water and juices. all room comes with these free snacks and drinks. and are replenished daily. There was no coffee machine in the  room but the hotel had a room services and there were many convenience store and cafes  near by the hotel so it wasn’t a big deal! The hotel also has Buffet style  breakfast from 06:30am to 10:30am. unfortunately, our plan didn’t include  the buffet but it is available at the cafe/restaurant behind the check in counter. This is the premium bathroom The toilet has a washlet And  the Amenities include shaving, shoe shine, nail set, comb,  toothbrush and many more Now let\u0027s check the hotel facilities. First and foremost, each level has a guest  kitchen where visitors can enjoy cooking! This shared kitchen was incredibly useful  when I was cooking late-night meals, and it is also where you can get ice as well! The hotel also includes a common laundry area. For 1000won, detergent and  dry sheets were provided. Finally, there is the Fitness Center. It is open between 12:00 AM and 12:00 AM. There were free weights, a stationary bicycle,  a treadmill, and other machines accessible. i was surprised by this machine because  this had all Pull, Push and leg capability. Now lets go see our second room. we Moved from number 907 to number 909. Our new room was right infant of  our old one so it was very easy. This is a twin bed room The room looks like this,  the structure is the same, but it is slightly smaller than the previous room. Instead of a sofa, it becomes a table and chair,  and the view becomes the scenery behind the hotel. You can see the convenience  store in the parking lot below. Drinks and all the amenities are also the same. The bathroom has a rain shower and hand shower. Our old room had no shower curtain when  using the bathtub, so the floor got wet, which was quite inconvenient. So if you want to relax in the bathtub,  I recommend the premium bathroom, but if you want to just shower, I recommend  reserving the normal shower room. Overall, the room was comfortable and  clean, and the hotel was conveniently located near the local subway station  so it was very easy to go around Seoul Everyone at the front desk was really kind and  helpful, and despite being on the main street, the hotel was very peaceful,  so I had no trouble sleeping. Although there was a convenience store close, running errands was inconvenient at  times, so I appreciated having a minibar. There was also a park nearby, which allowed  me to relax comfortably from the morning. For that reason I will  definitely come to visit again! I highly recommend staying at VOCO  Seoul Gangnam if you are looking for a hotel in a great location with  nearby services and a subway station!

{"video_id":"9Z-jGi7JPZs","lang":"en","full_text":"Fairmont Tempe, a new luxury hotel opened in Yeouido, was famous even before its opening as Logan\u0027s home in the drama Penthouse. Is it really as great as the rumors say? Let\u0027s find out today with \"Leaving Again\" [Music] Hello, I\u0027m a man again. Every time I pass by Yeouido, there\u0027s a building that steals my attention. It\u0027s the Yeouido Park One Tower, which is located in Seoul and the former Almond app. Honestly, the design with the exposed red building frame felt too old-fashioned at first, but it turned out that the design was inspired by the Form Pedestrian Center in Paris, France. It is a masterpiece. It is said that the characteristics of traditional Korean architecture were incorporated into the building\u0027s design. It is a representative luxury line of the Fence Acro Group, a famous hotel chain brand in the world. The Fairmont Ambassador Seoul, which was also featured in the drama \"Goblin\", is the Goseong Hotel in Quebec, Canada. In Korea, the Ambassador Group, a domestic hotel group, also opened its doors to the Fairmont Ambassador Seoul on February 24th.  The hotel opened. I visited on the 26th, two days after its opening. Upon entering, I had to go through a thorough temperature check and QR code scan before being allowed into the lobby. The first thing that caught my eye was the tall red pillar, a symbol of the building. Unlike the large and grand lobbies of past five-star hotels, modern hotels tend to have small and simple lobbies. I quickly entered the hotel lobby, which was decorated in a flashy and tall manner like the 5. At the entrance to the lobby, there is The Atrium Lounge. It uses a variety of colors while maintaining a unified modern black color scheme, creating a luxurious yet modern feel. I thought it gave the hotel a good first impression. However, it is so exposed that it takes less than 9 minutes to get into the hotel lobby, so it seems a bit disappointing to use it as a comfortable social space for business meetings. After passing through, the hotel check-in counter finally converges. It was small enough for two staff members to help check in at the same time, but the line grew longer around 3 p.m., the check-in time. There is also an internet desk in the center. The hotel rooms are divided into standard rooms, two suites, and a lounge.  The house where Kwon Ri-won lives can be divided into a penthouse, and the three standard rooms are the same size and there is not much difference in terms of facilities. Anyway, I stayed in a gold room, and this room included lounge access, and I was able to check in at the separate penthouse gold lounge on the third floor. I checked in at room 2710 1, Mugung. The door with the room number written on it is unique. If you go down the hallway, you will find the ventricle. Above all, I checked the puree butter, and I thought the overwhelming view of the Han River would be salty, but the overwhelming 04 equipment and party vibe are gathered. Even beyond the left apartment, the Han River and the land-based buildings are visible. When it was first announced that it would be a hotel in Yeouido Park One, I naturally thought that the hotel in this building that everyone was looking at would be built. However, the hotel is located on the easternmost side of the Park One building, and it faces the east side of Yeouido, not the Han River. It is a location that is difficult to get an overwhelming view of the Han River in the first place. To make matters worse, a large lighting Yeouido is under construction right in front of the hotel. It will be a little better once the construction is finished.  You can, but Pride Yeouido consists of four buildings, each with a maximum of 49 floors. I actually think it would be better during the military. 111 I calmed down and looked around the bedroom in earnest. It was a spacious space that made me think of following the guest room series. The clean blue-toned carpet and gold and brown-toned furniture gave it a warm feeling. I liked how the unique patterns and colors of the friends gave it a point. The wall behind the bed was decorated with wood from the Haring division and lighting was installed. I could feel that every detail was meticulously considered, including the trap and the lighting on both sides of the bed. There were lights on either side of the bed, but they were so sensitive that I was worried about them when sleeping at night. The bed was a Shinmo product, and the padding was soft, not just right. Next to the bed is an office space with unique metal decorations, and next to the window is a chair for looking out at the Han River view. There is an LG Electronics smart TV on the wall in front of the bed. The gold frame decoration at the back made it look very luxurious. It has a Chromecast function.  It can be used by connecting to a mobile phone. There is a mini bar space on the side. Deep sea water from Omul, Gosung-gun, Gangwon-do is provided, and it is provided to the Dilmah team, a Sri Lankan black tea brand, along with the self. An espresso coffee machine and capsules are also provided. All the dishes in the room are not easily available, but only the wine glasses are provided. The bathroom is located next to the hallway. The contrast between the light-colored marble and the dark sink and bathtub gives it a luxurious feel. One bathroom is provided with a bathtub and amenities. It is a Le Labo l Rose 30-day product, and salt is also provided with this wallpaper. In addition, an amenity kit with unified colors and textures is provided, and a Vias hairdryer is also provided. There is a shower booth and a toilet at the back, but it is not translucent, but completely transparent, so it may be a bit awkward to use the toilet and sink at the same time. In fact, the most unusual thing about the bathtub is that it has three sliding doors in the shape of a double door. The bathroom is connected to the guest room, but it is also connected to the bedroom on the opposite side. But this  What\u0027s interesting is that when you open the bathroom door, the hallway opens, the target opens, and the bathroom door closes. The shower booth and the bathroom door are similar to a double door, so you can\u0027t close both the shower booth and the bathroom at the same time. That\u0027s not the end. There are also sliding doors on the back of the three sides that can be opened. Personally, I think the double doors in the shower booth and bathroom are unavoidable for space utilization, but I wonder if the music in the hallway and bathroom will be upgraded. In addition, the handles on the sliding doors are very small, making it difficult to open the doors. There\u0027s no point in putting on and taking off. Considering there\u0027s even a sliding glass door, I think it\u0027s just an interior design concept. The down hanging on the hanger is very soft, which I like. There\u0027s a safe, shoe rack, and slippers below. Now that I\u0027ve stopped by a taxi, it\u0027s time to eat. Let\u0027s take a look at the Gold Lounge and how breakfast is served. First, you\u0027ll go to the Fairmont Gold Lounge on the third floor. The interior is an extension of the lobby lounge on the first floor. It\u0027s a sophisticated interior that incorporates strong primary colors with heavy and difficult colors as accents. The lounge isn\u0027t very large, so now you can enjoy the piano.  In cases like this, it was operated in two parts. Afternoon tea served from 2 to 4 pm. Check-in is at 3 pm and check-out is at 12 pm, but I thought the apple tart time was too ambiguous. It is unique in that there is a port train. The teacups are Indonesian products. A dessert consisting of a plate of Inda and no skill was served. You can take the drinks and fruit cookies from the refrigerator. Honestly, I wondered if the food could be this simple since it was at Fairmont, which claims to be the best port in Seoul. The drink selection was also embarrassing, and I asked if there was champagne under the refrigerator, but as expected, it was for TP. Thanks to the afternoon tea, I went to the evening happy hour without high expectations. It felt much better than I expected. Desserts and food of various cheeses were provided, but the variety was not that great. It was nice that champagne was provided, but the other alcoholic beverages were too poor. If you thought they served a variety of liquors, you might be very disappointed. Gold Lounge users have a separate breakfast.  If you don\u0027t add it, you\u0027ll have breakfast in the 3rd floor lounge, but I ended up having a regular breakfast at the 5th floor Spectrum. The breakfast was truly amazing. It was delicious, but the menu was full of things you\u0027d expect for a breakfast, and Peking duck was served. What hotel in the world serves Peking duck for breakfast? It\u0027s even delicious. The crispy baby skin was delicious, and I could chew it from the morning. Pillows and abalone were also served. The description: I wonder if I\u0027ve ever woken up early in the morning. The food was so good. I was satisfied with everything, and if you stay at the Fairmont, I highly recommend their breakfast. Currently, if you make a reservation through a Mastercard promotion on the Arcroad website, you can get free stocks. Let\u0027s take a look at the hotel\u0027s facilities. There\u0027s a Fairmont PC with a swimming pool and fitness center on the basement level. The pool isn\u0027t large, but it\u0027s nicely decorated. The seniors are also nicely equipped. The fitness center isn\u0027t that large, but it has techno-gym equipment. It was average, but it\u0027s a shame it\u0027s in the basement. I can\u0027t show you anything else, but Fairmont Gold guests have access to a sauna.  You can use the sauna and bathhouse for free. The facilities themselves are not that big. If so, what is your overall review of Ambassador Seoul? It\u0027s quite good, but I recommend going later. Above all, it seems like the staff are going through a lot of chaos because it\u0027s just opened. As a result, I heard complaints from guests here and there, and while I can understand it to some extent because it\u0027s just opened, I wonder if it\u0027s right for guests to understand the lack of service in a hotel that claims to be a 5-star brand. Rather than saying it\u0027s the staff\u0027s fault, I think it\u0027s because they opened too hastily without any systematic training or manuals. I was also disappointed with the inconsistent service. The difference in the type and quality of food between my friend who used the lounge the day before and me the next day was too big. It\u0027s not a hit or miss, but this will settle down over time. Let\u0027s talk a little more about the lounge. It was clearly disappointing compared to the dynamic competition of 5-star hotels. With the current level of service, I wonder if it\u0027s worth paying an extra 100,000 won to use it. The recent trend is for 5-star hotels to improve their quality, but everyone.  I felt sorry for Lowa. I was worried that the hotel would be experiencing a huge traffic jam due to the opening of The Hyundai Seoul. I also hope that there will be a vague alternative, such as separating hotel guests and general department store visitors and forming lines early. In that sense, I recommend visiting after 6 months or more when things have settled down to some extent, rather than right now. I had high expectations, so there were some disappointments, but I felt that the locks and guest room interiors were trendy and cool. It is connected to The Yeondae, which is the hottest place these days, and it has the advantage of being good for a quick trip to FC2 Mall. I recommend visiting with a couple, lover, or friends rather than with family or parents. However, it doesn\u0027t seem to be on par with the Grand Intercontinental, which has 4C dance, Shilla watches, and more. I hope that after some cool-headed feedback from the market, any shortcomings will be improved or the room rates will be somewhat cheaper than now. I would like to visit.

{"video_id":"Q_RXO6sBpbo","lang":"en","full_text":"good afternoon and a very warm welcome to a gorgeous summer\u0027s day here in so guys today I\u0027m going to be checking into the signal which is the hotel right up star in in the 79th story behind me at the latte World Tower it\u0027s one of the highest hotels in the world and also one of the best so I can\u0027t wait so let\u0027s Jump On In get checked in we\u0027ll check out the room and all of the facilities together first things first let\u0027s talk hotel location the signal hotel is nestled nicely within the central city area just near LTE world it\u0027s got a number of large malls and eating spots just in the media area and it works really nicely quite close also to a number of public transport links in terms of distance from the airport it\u0027s a fair odd way it was around 90 or so minutes by cab they do offer a transfer service over to inent airport it\u0027s quite an attractive drive just along the Han river which is indeed where the hotel is set on that morning that I arrived I got an Uber and it was around half the price if not slightly cheaper than the transfer that they were offering the Lotte world Tower which the hotel is setting is 555 M tall it\u0027s got 123 different floors and it\u0027s crazy to think that the hotel was nestled in some of the absolute topmost stories of it so I couldn\u0027t wait to get in and see exactly what it was going to be like from the moment that I arrived the staff were absolutely fantastic you arri into what is quite a grand entrance way the actual Lobby itself is way up on the 7 night floor so you then escorted into an elevator which takes no time at all to get you right up into into the skies where I started the check-in experience as I arrived up to the lobby I must say the views already were pretty special I was very early for the check-in the staff very kindly allowed me through into the lounge we could shed out and wait for the room itself to be ready they had a selection of free drinks and also free food into the evenings they also did some bits around alcoholic drinks and general entertainment it was a really amazing space and made for I start into the hotel I sat back with a couple of drinks and enjoyed what was an absolute phenomenal view out towards the ham River this was a space that was exclusively made available for hotel guests I wasn\u0027t expecting it at all I\u0027ve never seen this available in any of the luxury hotels that I said in so it was a really nice touch there was also a business center as part of it and talk about a desk with a view it was absolutely phenomenal by early afternoon my room was ready and that meant I could head up to the 89th floor where I\u0027d be staying to check out the room for the very first time I couldn\u0027t wait I\u0027d seen so many phenomenal pictures on the internet as to how exactly this hotel was going to be so let\u0027s Jump On In and check out the room together as I headed in one of the aspects that became immediately apparent as you do so often see with hotels of the standers it was the abundance of storage plenty of options as soon as you walked in and that continued right the way throughout the room I quite liked this double-sided wardrobe just here you\u0027ll see in a moment how that opens up into the bathroom as well next up let\u0027s check out that bathroom it was by far and above one of the standout features of the hotel for me and the story of the bathroom was Marble Marble Marble it was absolutely gorgeous I featured some really quite wonderful Hotel bathrooms and indeed rooms on the channel so far but this very much topped the more I loved how it was decked out yes it was Modern but it had some quite nice classical touches alongside as well although there indeed was an abundance of marble it wasn\u0027t gy like some hotel rooms are as you see I just thought it was absolutely phenomenal there was this big separate shower and bath area to the rest of the bathroom itself the toilet then went off onto another side there was then his and her sinks as well the whole thing together was just fantastic particularly light the inclusion of the toiletries these are done by duti I think the brand are called this is something that Qatar Airways use for their business class amenity kits as well those had a separate door that was leading out directly into the bedroom itself we\u0027ll actually loop back just now check out a little bit more around the storage into the bathroom and then we\u0027ll then head out into the room back through the door in which we came one thing that I particularly liked with all these additional doors opening up and through mether all of the focus of the room was on The View which of course is what you\u0027re really paying for just here in this extra special hotel leading out into the room itself I really liked how it\u0027s put together it was fresh it was Modern but it had that wonderful Touch of luxury with of course that huge great window leading up to the view which we\u0027ll check out in just a moment so what we saying that at this moment in time I just went for one of the standard rooms in the Hotel this is the one that\u0027s featured just here of course upgrading Beyond this it gets more and more special and that\u0027s something that I\u0027d love to check out one day one aspect that I always appreciate in rooms of this type is modern touches be it the lighting be it the charging the hotel had you very well covered on this front which was superb now when it came to revealing that fantastic view you didn\u0027t have to pull back the drapes yourself oh no not in a hotel of this quality simply just a case of pressing the button did take me a moment to work out exactly which one for the inner drapes and the outer drapes but as soon as I worked that out they then gently pulled back to reveal the most phenomenal view out over the city of Soul there\u0027s no number of great visors that could be enjoyed directly from the hotel my view was out over the Olympic Park and that was quite a nice one to have one thing that I Love About Soul is all of the mountains that surround the city on day two the views were even better so it\u0027s my pleasure to bring some of those to you just now shortly after arriving into the room itself I received this beautiful little welcome pack from the hotel\u0027s management had all of the information that you\u0027d need as part of the stay in a lot of lesser hotels these are the sort of things you get thrust upon you as part of the check-in experience you have to Lug around lots of pamphlets around the opening times of the gyms and other facilities it was nice to have these delivered into the room just so you had a bit of an overview of everything that was going on as part of the hotel there was a really fantastic spot unfortunately I didn\u0027t have the chance to try out on this occasion but we will head off in just a moment and see some of the facilities before we do so however let\u0027s touch briefly on the dining experiences now first things first I have never in my life seen such a large menu be even an in room dining menu it was absolutely massive this did Echo some of the other dining options were available throughout the hotel so I think they just kept it really nice and consistent whether you wanted to go down to the restaurant to have it or indeed to have it in the room we\u0027ll do a little bit on the dining a little bit later this was also then a selection that was dropped off into the room to help to make cocktails a little bit later into the evening the hotel even had their own brand here to PTO wine which I thought was incredibly fancy they then had some mixers and then also some Spirits as part of the mini bar so you could indeed make your own cocktails up as well as you\u0027d expect tea and coffee making facilities were available there was then also a selection of complimentary Waters as well next up we\u0027ll head up to the 85th floor and check out some of the additional Hotel facilities as part of the 85th floor they had a large gym complex some additional exercise Studios coming off it the gym itself was wonderfully large had some really nice modern machinery looking out over of course those wonderful views there was also a pool area and Spar that was up here didn\u0027t get a chance to film either of those but in terms of facilities they were all wonderfully quiet and looked absolutely brilliant I\u0027d love to come back they a little bit longer and really do these Justice and after all of that exploring of Soul they had a turned down service into the evening I thought this was a wonderful little touch and it rounded off what was a brilliant first day at the hotel now what I\u0027m not usually one for hotel breakfast we\u0027re going to check out some of the catering of the hotel and grab some lunch at one of their restaurants so let\u0027s head on down and see exactly what that\u0027s like my search that afternoon led me to the lounge this is a restaurant that\u0027s located neatly within the hotel lobby so it benefits from those fantastic views out of the window so terms of the menu just like the room service menu this was absolutely massive which was convenient because I was actually looking for something with a bit more of a brunch star of flavor on that afternoon thankfully they had a number of good selections so I sat back with a fresh pineapple juice and enjoyed those wonderful views before the food arrived in the end I opted for a club sandwich just like everything else at the hotel it was wonderfully put together particularly like the presentation just there of the side salad really hope today\u0027s video was interesting for you if you\u0027re Keen to stay on the topic of absolute luxury I\u0027ve recently flown with brush in their first class and I\u0027ll put a link to that video

observation and experience first up those lifts a bit confusing especially for those of us with a questionable sense of direction been there I\u0027m one of them now about the service while generally topnotch there were instances where it felt a bit too much bordering over the top finding that sweet spot between attentiveness and sincerity can be tricky and oh the sheer number of Staff while not a bad thing can be too overwhelming I can\u0027t help but think about places struggling with Manpower especially in the postco era it seems they went all out together a massive theme which has its pros and cons then the room Chang on the third night not ideal but hey this things happen even in a new property the sliding door issue was a snag and it\u0027s surprising but construction Falls can pop up ra job to the duty manager for personally attending to the matter and being genuinely apologetic fun story this Duty manager was so Keen to carry everything himself and you can sense his embarrassment about the situation yet we tried to lighten the mood reassuring him that we\u0027re easygoing Travelers even if it was a bit inconvenient to pack and clear our personal stops we didn\u0027t mind and we\u0027re more than willing to handle it ourselves to our pleasant surprise the next day the manager presented us with a delightful gift a thoughtful gesture as an apology or a way to make amends for the inconvenience still a good job in summary as a new player in the hotel scene sopal Ambassador soul is hitting the right notes our overall experience left us happy and despite a few minor hiccups they are easily forgivable with that we give this hotel a Sal 9.5 out of 10 help plus for more details about the property booking and Acer membership check out the website provided in the description

Like to offer you the watermelon lemonade Thank  you That looks good And we have arrived by speedboat to one of the most exclusive resorts  in the world that rivals the Maldives This is the one of the first resorts ever opened in the  Red Sea here in Saudi Arabia And I\u0027m so excited to be here And welcome to N Juma Aritz Carlton  Reserve one of the most exclusive properties This is the beautiful welcome area After  you arrive by speedboat you are taken here a beautiful welcome drink cold towel and then  you\u0027re escorted by your personal host by golf cart to your villa They have 63 villas All of  them are absolutely extraordinary with private beaches and some over the water This place is  beautiful in every single way Let\u0027s check it out [Music] Welcome to our twobedroom  beach villa We have arrived This is incredible This is actually all made  of ropes There\u0027s over 1.5 million miles of rope constructing just this property alone alone here  at Num Numa This is my second Ritz Carlton Reserve Extremely exclusive We\u0027ve been traveling for days  just to get here But I want to show it to you We have two entrances two entrances to our room  Just incredible So this is a little bit different than other Ritz Carlton properties or hotels in  general The key to access the room is actually a bracelet that they give you right here So Njuma  So we\u0027re going to go ahead and open up Boom Here we go Let\u0027s head on inside [Music] And here we  are into the beautiful living room Now when we first got escorted here and we walked in I was  completely speechless I didn\u0027t even know what to say This is probably the biggest room I\u0027ve ever  had twobedroom I\u0027ve never two bedrooms is just massive We have a huge living room But I have to  start with the design This is one of the coolest design properties in the world and is so unique  From the ceiling all the wood paneling to the ropes on the outside just the different furniture  this incredible telescope that your eye goes right to This is truly a masterpiece and work of art  I am absolutely speechless I want to start with thanking them They actually made a beautiful cake  here that says 29 As this is my 29th Ritz Carlton I really wanted it to be my 30th but I just could  not stay at the Ritz Carlton Jetta For some reason it just looked a little bit on the older side so  we stayed at the luxury collection But regardless 29 here is amazing I actually put out all of my  Ritz Carlton key cards here The 29th one right here Njuma So that\u0027s the proof I\u0027ve been to all  of these But this one by far is probably going to be one of the best right up there with Mandepaw  Ritz Carlton Reserve That was the other one that I stayed at They had a welcome note here They showed  us all the different amenities in the room how everything works We not only have the two bedrooms  one has two beds one has a king bed We also have a kitchen and toilet which I\u0027ll show you in just a  little bit But first I want to take you into the first bedroom You can already see kind of right  outside here We\u0027re on the beach So they have both beach villas as well as the ocean villas The ocean  overwater ones they\u0027re actually right out there You can see them They go in a circle They actually  offered us either option They have a two-bedroom one out there and they have a two-bedroom one here  on the beach We actually chose the beach one even though it\u0027s a little more reasonable because you  have your own private beach access We can walk right down there I\u0027ll show you that later and go  to the beach The other ones you don\u0027t It\u0027s over the water so it\u0027s really unique Uh but you don\u0027t  have that And we are going to be at the St Reges which is actually right across the way 10-minute  boat ride away and we will have an overwater villa for that one So I thought for this one the beach  one was perfect Heading into the bedroom itself Wow this is a bedroom I can\u0027t believe there\u0027s the  two beds in here which is just beautiful These are actually pretty large I\u0027d say these are at least  double beds They call them twins but they\u0027re at least it\u0027s double size I love that there\u0027s the  carpeting around the beds The rest of the room is the hardwood floor And this ceiling is just  gorgeous It\u0027s It\u0027s not even a wall up there It\u0027s all this wood paneling I wish more hotels took  more time and did an amazing design on the ceiling because this is beautiful We have a fan here Now  the nice thing about this property is there is air conditioning so it feels so good in here The  air conditioning works great Some really exclusive hotels sometimes don\u0027t have it like the JW Mars  Mara in Kenya That hotel reminds me a lot of this one but there is no air conditioning in those  tents At night time it cools down quite a bit so you really don\u0027t need it But here it\u0027s really  nice cuz it gets extremely hot up to like even 100° Fahrenheit during the day I love the pillows  around the beds I love the lighting Every single detail is perfect and flawless There\u0027s literally  nothing I could criticize in this room It is beautiful Just just how it goes all the way down  I love it You can also walk 360 degrees around the bed Behind the bed here we have a work desk which  is awesome When you\u0027re sitting down though this kind of obstructs the view but you can look over  and look right out They actually set up our bags here and place them in the villa So that\u0027s awesome  But even like the walls here like it\u0027s not just a flat wall it\u0027s textured Just adds such a unique  feel to the room And then over here we have like a little seating area You can sit down You can  take a good look at just how beautiful the room is the views So really special [Music] All right  I want to show you the closet space real quick We have two giant closets one in here one in the  other room They have every luxury amenity you could want They have the Dyson Air Wrap which is  just so next level They have the safe They have down here just a shoe bag safe They even have  a steamer for your clothes Over here we have more storage units with hangers And then over here  they have not only robes which I\u0027ll show you these in a second Beautiful robe that says Numa Highly  approved very thick comfortable just amazing They also have thinner robes These are a lot thinner So  if you\u0027re really hot you just want something light you can put those on So you have both options  There\u0027s another one of these in the bathroom too They also have plush slippers So many resorts  I\u0027ve been to all the ones in Bali didn\u0027t even have these They all have like the hard slippers and  these I definitely approve of These are extremely plush Look at that Closed towed really soft large  amazing I love soft slippers Now next to the beds they also have these here So this is an option In  Bali this is pretty much all they had They just had these harder shoes So I love having the soft  slippers as well So here you get both options as part of your stay So that\u0027s awesome Now I want to  show you the bathroom number one There\u0027s actually three bathrooms This is like the one bathroom for  this room here It\u0027s really beautifully designed Every detail about this place I\u0027m just going crazy  It\u0027s so beautiful But we have a tub in here It doesn\u0027t have a view but it\u0027s still a very nice  soaking tub It\u0027s very long I like the different texturing You have the this you have this marbling  and then you have the slanted design like they did not have to do this but it just adds so much  extra to the room We have the rope here and then the shower area is extra special because it has  these really cool almost mosaic like tilings all the way around it Amazing rainfall shower which  is what I look for Dip teique soaps but it also has the experience shower jets on the side and  then an extra kind of rainfall shower over here toilet area its own private space and that mosaic  tiling goes all the way up And I just love that design how it kind of triangulates downwards  Gorgeous We have a really cool lamp here In the evening when you dim the light down it actually  puts off really cool pattern And then we have the one sink here but remember there\u0027s two more  bathrooms so you have plenty of sinks in the room if you need it Beautiful soap here They have  these big containers not only in the shower but here eliminating the single-use plastics with the  Dip Teique soaps So just every little design and detail from even this tissue box with the wood  on top the gold accent just everything is just absolutely beautiful For the tub we even have  the bath salts which is which is also something that I look for We have the shower cap we have  the lof pad and then the shower gel here for the tub as well We also do have the doors here that  completely close this area off for privacy if so Now come on around I can\u0027t wait to show you the  rest of the room As we continue around we have really cool like art So like instead of this just  being a flat wall they put this here So I just think that\u0027s great It just kind of covers up that  flat wall But even the wall how it kind of curves and then up top that netting It\u0027s just so amazing  We have a big TV here And then here\u0027s a couple souvenirs we actually get to take home Beautiful  glass bottle with a Njuma sleeve and a hat So just really nice little keepsakes there It\u0027s amazing  It\u0027s a part of Marriott Bonvoy I\u0027m actually redeeming points to stay here So it\u0027s a great  points value if you\u0027re choosing to stay because the cash rate is extremely expensive All right now  here we are back in the living area I want to go over this area just a little bit more But first  I want to show you we have a fullsize kitchen over here I guess maybe not considered full size  but it is really cool how we have this space but they have so much here I mean we literally have  a stove top We\u0027re going to get food to like cook here I don\u0027t know cuz we\u0027re on an island We have  an oven down below We have a whole fridge over here with drinks in here Now these drinks are all  for purchase but we have different kind of juices Peach nectar strawberry pear ginger beer There\u0027s  nothing alcoholic on this island Down below we have a freezer This is the complimentary section  with the espresso machine and it\u0027s actually wrapped in leather That is so extra Little teacups  espresso pods and then all the fancy teas in here So that\u0027s great Plenty of complimentary waters  and then the kettle to boil that hot water ice bucket These are for purchase up here Some nuts  Down below we even have a fullsize dishwasher So if we need to wash anything that\u0027s there And then  up top we have all the different cups and glasses All right Now back to the living area I just want  to go over I love the carpeting in the middle It\u0027s extremely spacious and with this it\u0027s extremely  high ceilings I love this lamp Just a really cool design We also have a whole table here That\u0027s  where they put the cake But you have six seats So I mean I think a lot of maybe large families  stay here and they maybe have a few dune villas So they can kind of all gather into one and they  can all maybe have a meal here Room service Room service is an option We have some little cool like  artifacts over here But again I just love how this wood just goes down the building itself This is  almost like a walnut shaped husk the design I was reading about So it\u0027s kind of unique We have  a very high-owered and fancy telescope This is not just for decoration This is like extremely  looks expensive and really high quality but you can kind of look out into the sea I\u0027m assuming So  that\u0027s just it\u0027s just a really cool art piece if anything Now I want to quickly show you the other  bedroom and then we\u0027re going to take a look right outside here because we have our own pool We  even have our own beach and then we have our own like shower outside So big So here\u0027s the other  bathroom This is kind of like a half bath It has the toilet and sink but it\u0027s just so extra to have  that there as well We also have another TV in this room So if you want to be relaxing on the sofa  watching TV you can with a notepad And we have one of the coolest Bluetooth speakers here This is a  really high-end quality one BNO It\u0027s fully charged So this is awesome because I was actually hoping  on this trip I did not bring my personal speaker because I was hoping that they were going to have  a good one here and they do This is great I\u0027m going to take this outside while we\u0027re lounging by  the pool and we can play some tropical music That adds so much ambiance to Bluetooth connect that So  if you\u0027re staying here definitely take advantage of that Here we are into the other bedroom This  is really the master bedroom because it has the large king-size bed The bathroom also I think is  a little bit more high-end but it\u0027s still just as nice I love the ottoman in front of the bed It\u0027s  just kind of great to put your suitcases on Love the carpeting around the bed I just love this  design and how you\u0027re facing your pool and the beautiful view And I have to say the water here  the color is just really special It\u0027s like the bluest water I\u0027ve ever seen It\u0027s bluer than Bali  It\u0027s bluer than Hawaii It\u0027s bluer than pretty much every place I\u0027ve ever been It\u0027s just gorgeous  That turquoise color We have another seating area over here which is great because you can  be sitting down looking at your beautiful room outside I don\u0027t think I\u0027m going to want to leave  whole closet space here with just more places to store things as well as a blanket and an ironing  board Around the corner here we have the bathtub Now the bathtub in this room is actually in the  room itself so there\u0027s no privacy for this bathtub but it\u0027s kind of cool because I like the lighting  underneath I love these lanterns I think at night they all turn on but it\u0027s just a really cool  design tub because when you\u0027re in here you\u0027re kind of like experiencing the room the view So  really cool We have another work desk here with a little bench and really cool pen it looks like  that says Numa on it Just like I\u0027ve never seen anything quite like that Really beautiful pen  Here\u0027s the bathroom It also closes for privacy Nice lighting This bathroom is a little bit  higher end because it has the two sinks Shower I think also is a little bit bigger Still has  the rainfall shower and the experience gent We have the separate toilet area here with the space  So just I love this design So we have two showers in the room We have this toilet the other toilet  and there\u0027s even a third toilet which I\u0027ll show you All the amenities here These are really cool  Kind of tying in the theme of Saudi Arabia Towel rack Just really cool This ladder here like every  detail is just wow It\u0027s great they have this here cuz you like to I like to have a place to hang up  towels when I\u0027m done using them I don\u0027t just want to put it on the floor So that\u0027s great The lotion  really cool lamp that really cool tissue box again And it\u0027s just you just feel you just feel so  special in here Like every detail is thought out I just love how this kind of comes to a point here  Just really cool You just feel amazing Now for the main attraction we\u0027re going to head right on out  to our beautiful private pool only for us We have a beautiful pool here and they can actually adjust  the temperature slightly if you need a little bit warmer a little bit cooler They said we have  two lounge chairs there And then we also have the two lounge chairs on the other side We have  another whole table with four seats there And then we have two nice couches here More chairs  So I mean there\u0027s so many places to sit I mean how many people do they expect to stay in this  villa 10 I\u0027m not sure But you just have places for everyone So what\u0027s nice about this villa is  the ones over the water Like I mentioned it just kind of basically ends here Everything\u0027s pretty  much the same size I actually think this pool is a little bit smaller there You can just hop in  the ocean But the great thing about these beach ones is we have a lot more going on First we have  our own outdoor shower And this is when you\u0027re done being at the beach and you\u0027re all sandy  to rinse off before you go into your villa to keep the sand from getting in Or if you want more  privacy we have another outdoor shower over here And this acts as the same thing You can shower  off in here before going into your villa but it\u0027s more private because you\u0027re surrounded by this  wood So these are extra items that these beach villas have that the overwater villas do not have  [Music] All right Now we also have our own little boardwalk which is amazing to take us out onto the  beach So we can basically just walk right out from our villa and relax in the beach go in the water  and then come right back into our villa So I\u0027ll stop here but you can just see how beautiful the  water is You can also have a little bit clearer view of the overwater villas there So I guess in  everyone\u0027s mind when you think of coming to either Maldives or here you\u0027re thinking of a villa over  water like that But honestly I\u0027m just as happy with this beach one for those reasons I mentioned  And we have our own beach here Now if you are in one of those or in general they also have their  own private beaches just for guests here with their own pools beach club So you can still go to  the main pool and relax there They have an adult pool a kids and family pool they have a hot tub so  you can use the one in your room and the one there So so many different options But I am blown away  I don\u0027t even know if I covered everything because there was so much going on But let\u0027s take a look  at the rest of the resort And welcome to Numa This place is incredible I can\u0027t wait to show you  the rest of the resort Let\u0027s take a look Welcome to the stunning Ritz Carlton Reserve Najuma A  destination unlike any other and one of the most significant milestones in the history of Marriott  and the Red Sea This is not just a new hotel It\u0027s the very first Ritz Carlton reserve in the Middle  East and the first of its kind in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Numa opened in May 2024 and it\u0027s part  of the ultra luxury development known as the Red Sea Global Project a cornerstone project of Saudi  Arabia\u0027s Vision 2030 We\u0027re here on Umahhat Island and this resort is made up of basically three  parts It has the two white sandy beaches that have a lot of the beach villas and then it has the ring  with the circle villas at the very end It has a tail here that kind of sticks off with additional  overwater villas These are not in the circle but these are kind of towards the end of the other  island Now our journey began in Dubai where I wanted to stay at the St Reges downtown again  And then we flew to Jedha And then from Jedha they have non-stop flights on Saudi Air straight  to the Red Sea airport which is RSI Now these are not tiny planes These are full size about 737s  here that take you to the island The flight was actually pretty empty from Jedha to the Red Sea  And the Red Sea project out here they\u0027re actually building a huge terminal in hopes to really boost  tourism in the country When you first arrive here they have all the different resorts that are part  of the Red Sea project You can basically check in there And since we were staying at the Ritz  Carlton we were then escorted outside here where we then got picked up in a very fancy Mercedes It  almost felt like a spaceship This is part of the transfer option It is extra charge and everyone  who stays at the property does have to pay for it It includes the drive to one of the other sister  resorts and then from there you are picked up by either speedboat yacht or you can even elect to  do a sea plane which will or helicopter which will actually take you straight I believe from the  RS air RSI airport to the property or C plane from this other resort to the property but those  were a lot more expensive So we opted for the cheapest package which was this one It came out  to about $270 per person but that is round trip which include includes the travel to the resort  as well as going back to the RSI airport after Now the property they take you to here is called  Turtle Bay Resort And this is where you will then be escorted inside where you can have a seat relax  they\u0027ll bring you some water and then they\u0027ll come and get you when the speedboat was ready Now Saudi  Arabia in general is a lot more open to tourists than they were many years ago and outsiders So  there\u0027s no like strict dress codes We could all pretty much wear whatever we wanted And that was  not only here in the Red Sea but also in Jedha and Riyad And we did walk around and we were out  and about and everyone was just extremely friendly The country is trying to really boost tourism They  have a ton of mega projects in the works right now across the country And out here at the Red Sea  they\u0027re actually building quite a few different resorts including even Four Seasons Andes and  pretty much every luxury branded hotel you can think of They\u0027re going to be opening a ton of new  resorts hoping to really boost tourism Everyone is extremely friendly They\u0027re open to foreigners  and to get a visa coming from the USA was not that difficult You can do the whole thing simply  online Now here we were We were escorted out by golf cart from the Turtle Bay Resort And then here  are some of the different transfer options So the hotel ahead of time will actually send you a a  letter in the email and it\u0027ll offer the different transportation options So this is the speedboat  This is the standard price so the most reasonable which is totally fine with me It was still an  extreme luxury experience but it basically has lots of seats So sometimes you\u0027re uh sharing the  boat with people going to the sister properties including like the St Regis or the Shabara  which is like the spaceship looking hotel So this is all part of the Red Sea project and uh  Red Sea Global and they take guests to all the different resorts The journey was about 30 minutes  or so 20 to 25 minutes It depends on of course uh the waves and the it is the ocean so sometimes it  can get a little bit rough but it was a beautiful uh boat ride out Just one of the most unique  experiences You\u0027re literally cruising over some of the most untouched reef systems in the  world The color of the water is also deep blue and turquoise in every direction and it is  just stunning Now here we are arriving at Najuma You can see it there in the distance There\u0027s the  beautiful beach and the huts What a cool arrival experience Now when we arrived there was actually  a whole team of people waiting for us on the dock like three or four or five different people that  were all expecting our arrival It\u0027s a very private experience but the detail in service here is  flawless Every single review that I\u0027ve read my experience they could not have done enough for us  It\u0027s just one of the most incredible experiences So when you arrive by boat you\u0027re taken off Uh the  people from the hotel assist you with your luggage so you don\u0027t even have to worry about that They  unload it from the boat for you and take it in You\u0027re then walked up this walkway to the arrival  area The experience felt so unreal because this was my first time ever staying at a property  like this that even has overwater villas cuz I\u0027ve never been to the Maldives Now right away when we  arrived everyone was smiling happy to greet us We were handed cold towels and then we actually got  to smell the famous uh incense smell of the local area and culture So that was an incredible  immersive experience They also had a yummy lemonade welcome drink So they definitely checked  all the boxes for service staff just fantastic We also were introduced to our personal host Hina was  absolutely incredible She made sure every detail of our stay was perfectly executed But every  single staff member we encountered was friendly kind and caring We didn\u0027t meet anyone who didn\u0027t  care about our experience or who wasn\u0027t friendly But this arrival area is excellent because you  can basically relax You can take a breath when you first arrive And then they also are able to  answer any questions that you have And then you are escorted all the way to your room where you  actually are performed the check-in at your room So no need to go to a front desk or any other  area like that Before we got to our room our personal host showed us all around the island We  got to kind of see where the spa was The island is basically made up into three parts It has  the circle with the overwater villas and then it also has then the two islands here that are  connected with the sand They were mostly already in place Um they were added to a little bit but  the details are stunning no matter where you look The landscaping is also flawless I kind of thought  for a while because it\u0027s in the middle of the desert the landscaping might not be as nice but  the landscaping is perfect They have trees just all the different plants and bushes everywhere It  is just really beautiful Now here we are arriving We are passing by the spa The spa is topnotch In  fact it was rated I think the best spa in Saudi Arabia for one of the magazines And fast forward  because towards the end of this video we\u0027ll give you the full experience there at the spa They also  have steam room sauna and that\u0027s all included for guests Now our villa was relatively close but some  of the villas can be pretty spread out They can go all the way down the beach but ours was right  here And this was one of the twobedroom villas So it\u0027s a upgrade they did for us complimentary  Typically this is not really something that they would upgrade to but in March it\u0027s actually  Ramadan So they do not have a lot of guests staying here The property was pretty empty So  they were kind enough to upgrade us to this huge villa I\u0027ve never had anything this big but it is  stunning The outside design they\u0027re made to look like walnuts So there\u0027s so many detail as well as  the ropes that I touched on earlier But they have not faded They look clean They look modern They\u0027ve  taken exceptionally good care of the property They also had three bikes right outside for us ready  to go Those are great because you can bike all the way around the island Or at any time you can just  call up your personal host and they will come pick you up in golf cart any time of the day or night  and take you anywhere you need to go on the island whether it\u0027s to a restaurant the beach the spa  So you can either bike walk or just get picked up First impressions were wow I don\u0027t even know what  I did when I first walked in The room was just so incredible Looking out at our private pool the  ocean there is nothing like it They were extremely quick delivering the luggage and right away I put  out all my other Ritz Carlton key cards and they had the beautiful celebration cake there in the  room I absolutely love the design the lighting the details everything was perfect Like this is the  most perfect hotel One of the most perfect ones I\u0027ve ever been to Now from the room we were taken  out over across the bridge This is kind of the middle part which is between the two islands where  the ring is of all the overwater villas I got to tour also the overwater villas They are also just  beautiful The name Njuma means stars in Arabic and that inspiration is woven into every aspect of the  experience From stargazing telescopes placed in every villa to astrology themed drinks served  at night This entire destination was designed around nature astronomy culture and privacy The  property has 63 villas total just laid out like seashells in the water or nestled into the beach  These are 1 two and very few three-bedroom villas each with their own private pool Massive outdoor  terrace panoramic views and an ele elegant design inspired by the tones and textures of sand shells  and coral Now here we are at the overwater villas in the ring They have about 21 of their 63 villas  here Now you may be wanting to experience you know the overwater experience And honestly the beach  villa we had was just as good and we elected for it because we had our own private beach and it was  just as nice But maybe if we come back next year we would opt for one of these just to have both  But I did get a tour here of the two bedroomedroom villa over the water The inside looks identical to  our villa The only difference is when you look out your windows you literally just see the blue water  right there which is actually really amazing You feel like you\u0027re just floating or on a cruise ship  It\u0027s definitely a really cool experience compared to the beach villa But otherwise everything else  about the inside of the room is the same The one bedroom here had the two beds with the same  bathroom setup as ours same living room and then it also had the same patio although this patio  was smaller The pool is also a little bit smaller on these compared to the beach villas It also had  the room here with the king bed same tub and same dual sink bathroom here in the master bedroom But  regardless it is stunning I will be honest from the bed looking out directly over the water it is  definitely a cooler view in my opinion than the beach villa But again the patio here is a little  bit smaller The plunge pool\u0027s a little bit smaller as well And then you don\u0027t have a beach but you  can directly jump into the ocean if you\u0027d like They do have a railing then here to bring you  right on back up The water is safe but that color is just so tropical We did elect to get an  overwater coral villa at the St Reges Resort So definitely subscribe You will not want to miss  that review And that one I was able to jump into the ocean and give you my full experience there  But those are the two different options Of course the standard rooms they look pretty much identical  They just don\u0027t have this separate bedroom here They just have the one main bedroom with living  area While the property took approximately 3 years to build each one-bedroom villa took about  19 to 21 days to fully construct and finish This includes all the 1.5 million m of rope cladding  that were all handinstalled to create a cocooned organic texture that\u0027s never been done before  at this scale The team behind this said it\u0027s one of the most ambitious architectural finishes  they\u0027ve ever attempted and it truly sets Numa apart visually I\u0027ll include the link below It\u0027s  a two-minute video and they actually explain and show how they built a lot of Njuma in the villas  Now let\u0027s talk about one of the most memorable parts of our stay the dining We\u0027re starting  with Sitta This is the main restaurant where we had breakfast in the morning They also serve food  throughout the day Ceda is derived from the Arabic word meaning six referencing the six senses as  well as it does have six pavilions which feature different uh experiences depending on which  pavilion or area you\u0027re in In the middle they also have a central clay oven which performs uh fresh  bread making and hosting also bread makingaking classes as one of the activities on property  These dome-like structures are architectural centerpieces Warm open and beautifully integrated  into the surrounding nature They provide shade and air flow while maintaining that sense of being  connected to the outdoors It\u0027s really a wow experience It\u0027s centrally located there right  kind of in the heart of the ring with all the villas surrounding it So it\u0027s really beautiful  You can look out and you can see the villas over the water the beautiful turquoise water And the  setting is amazing You can sit outside here or if you prefer air conditioning you can sit inside at  one of their different pavilions to have breakfast or throughout the day to have other things to  eat Here we are heading into the spice library This is one of the pavilions It has a very strong  fragrance of all the different spices and you can smell them But a lot of these are ingredients used  in the different dishes These pavilions overall are basically separated into two main dining  venues these two distinct culinary experiences It first starts with the area which is the French  style petissicisserie where they have freshly the smell of freshly baked croissants in the morning  They have some Arabian coffee things like that The second section is the Levantine restaurant  and this is where the magic of the Middle East really comes alive At the heart of that space is  the central clay oven which serves as both the kitchen\u0027s focal point and a source of irresistible  aroma You\u0027ll smell the fresh bread being baked as soon as you walk in Flatbreads and a lot of  other hot items from the oven Now I want to take you through our full breakfast experience  as it was truly one of the most magical and most rememberable breakfast of our lives When we  first arrived we were greeted very warmly and we were offered a cup of Arabian coffee Now in their  culture it\u0027s important to know they only fill up the cup about halfway and that\u0027s a sign of good  respect Otherwise if it\u0027s filled up all the way it means almost like \"Okay you\u0027re finished here  Move on.\" So it\u0027s cool to experience that They also had some dates so we were able to try those  right away in the morning But the setting here is just beautiful It was very personalized There  were not a lot of other guests on the island so we were able to just let them know when we wanted to  have breakfast and they were all waiting there and happy to greet us From there we can turn continued  our journey inward where we were more warmly greeted by more of the staff and we were allowed  to decide where we wanted to sit Now I definitely recommend spending one day and sitting out here  in the open air pavilion It is just beautiful It has the best views The stunning views make it  just perfect However certain times of the day it can get really hot outside and we came pretty  late morning so it was already pretty warm So we opted to sit inside here in one of the pavilions  It was a beautiful setting We still had a great view but it felt a lot more comfortable Now we  were the only one sitting inside here the whole time They actually did a special breakfast for  us They started off with some yummy freshly baked croissants It was one of the best I\u0027ve ever had  with a cream filling We also ordered cappuccinos And this gentleman here actually won a latte art  competition in Dubai And he can do pretty much any design It is stunning the latte art he can do I\u0027ve  never seen anyone be able to do such amazing latte art Now for the experience they gave us the full  Arabian course meal for breakfast We could try a lot of the local dishes We have here the falafel  It comes with humus and with tahina And we have here mud gal We have also the fools and the sakupa  And also you have your manate z manate and cheese manakish You have your labna and humus Please  enjoy and other dishes from around the world They basically just wanted to do this special for  us Give us this whole experience They also even made me a little welcome note before we left and  our other guests some dates and some special gifts The service was literally perfect They could not  have done enough for us One of the most memorable breakfasts of our entire life From this center  point on the island we\u0027re going to continue around to the other island So this is the island that  our villa was not on It\u0027s past the rings in the other direction And over here you have different  options You have more dining venues You also have a couple beaches and some more activities to do  It\u0027s also fun to ride the bikes because you can go to these different islands across these overwater  bridges and it\u0027s a really special experience Next up is Tabra Now this restaurant was closed during  our stay due to Ramadan as there\u0027s not hardly any guests on property let alone eating during the  day So I just got a tour here so I can show you but it is open the rest of the year just not in  March usually But it\u0027s a beautiful setting because you have amazing views and you have both inside  and outside seating Designed to feel like the home of a local fisherman this restaurant is all  about honoring the culture and traditions where generations of fishing families have lived off  these waters for over 50 years The interior feels warm textured and very personal with decorative  touches that remind you of an old coastal home filled with stories sea treasures and community  pride And I love that it\u0027s not just about food it\u0027s about storytelling This is where you\u0027re  encouraged to share tales poetry even philosophy just like fishermen would do after a long day on  the water There\u0027s something deeply nostalgic and communal about the whole experience In the back of  the restaurant they even have an old fishing boat to truly set the tone and help you be aware of  your surroundings and the history and culture of the area This restaurant is only open for dinner  and means the luckiest catch of the day It is inspired by Spain and Saudi Arabian food Next up  on this same part of the island but closer to the start of it we have the other main restaurants  here along with the pools and a beach area This restaurant here is called Jamaa And this is the  relaxed open air restaurant located here like I mentioned by the pool and beach It\u0027s the perfect  place to spend your afternoon especially if you\u0027re hanging out in one of the cabanas or just enjoying  the breeze off the Red Sea You can order drinks or food there as well But these tables are just  breathtaking The views it\u0027s stunning There\u0027s so many different places to eat There\u0027s uh open air  outside here with the covered shade but service was perfect But again for our dinner we were  basically one of the only guests here for dinner But the dinner was amazing I\u0027ll give you that full  experience shortly but I just want to show you the views I definitely recommending sitting at one  of these tables here towards the edge because you can look at at the beautiful pool area and out  into the ocean Inside the building here we have uh MIA which is the astrology inspired cocktail  lounge It\u0027s all about atmosphere This spot is inspired by astronomy and named after one of the  stars in the area The whole experience revolves around celestial energy from the drink names to  the design It\u0027s perched slightly above the main boardwalk area here with wide open views of  the night sky This is the kind of place where you come for a slow evening to relax and unwind  Keep in mind here all of these drinks are going to be non-alcoholic as no alcohol is permitted in  the country However that is changing including at these Red Sea resorts where alcohol will be  available I believe at some point in 2026 but only for guests Uh more to come on that Definitely  check out different news articles Now I want to walk you through our dinner experience here A lot  of times hotels the food can be very expensive so we don\u0027t always have dinner at the properties but  here you don\u0027t really have a choice And also it\u0027s one of the most memorable settings ever So we were  able to experience the incredible dinner Here\u0027s a look at the menu I got one of the pasta dishes  We also got one of the flatbread appetizers with mushroom And everything we got was just fantastic  and tasted excellent The chef even came over to check in on us during our meal To start the  night they baked us some freshly baked almost pita bread from their oven which tasted amazing  They had different things to put on it And then here is that I believe mushroom truffle flatbread  There\u0027s my pasta It was absolutely amazing I got it with chicken and a white sauce Here was one  of the fish dishes as well as one of the steak dishes Everything we got was just fantastic But  the best part is definitely looking out over the water at the beautiful pool ocean in the distance  and especially for sunset Best time ever It was very comfortable outside to sit here and eat The  weather cools down quite a bit towards sunset so we enjoyed it very much Right here we have the  pool and beach areas So we\u0027ll just go ahead right into this part of the review So here we are We not  only have the nice sandy beaches you can go in the water They have cabanas They have family pools  They have adult pools They have a hot tub Service was also fantastic Every time we even came near  the pool beach area they always have an attendant Ask if you need anything They\u0027ll set up your  chairs with the towels and it is just beautiful The cabanas are perfectly placed I also want you  to notice the landscaping Every palm tree every bush nothing is out of place Everything is watered  perfectly It is gorgeous The furniture is freshly stained all the wood All of the chairs had nice  pads on them Everything I looked for There were even flowers It was extremely comfortable They  have outdoor showers And then here\u0027s a quick look This is the adults only pool here which is nice  So you can actually head right on in here And then it also does have a hot tub off to the side They  also will bring you water if you need to at any time when I was even sitting in the hot tub right  next to the adult pool The host even came over and asked if I wanted a Bluetooth speaker so I could  listen to music while I\u0027m at the pool They just go above and beyond trying to accommodate your every  single request There also was never really anyone out here while we were here So it felt like an  extremely private experience Now right inside here from the pool behind it is a unique feature  It\u0027s actually a kids area So if you\u0027re a family staying at the resort you can check your children  in here And they have a whole place to play not only inside but also outside There are games and  toys places for them to sit down books to read It even has floor to ceiling windows with incredible  views There\u0027s different play areas so it\u0027s amazing If you just want to relax and have time to for  yourself you can be at the pool beach relaxing while your kiddos are in here having the time  of their life Additionally right outside there\u0027s another huge play area with sprinkler system set  up for the kids with all kinds of fun toys and games for them to run around and get wet So this  is definitely going to keep them busy for hours on end Definitely one of the best features of the  property Now in the evening the resort comes to life just as well Everything is perfectly lit Even  all of the bridges here have the lights They even have the volleyball courts lit up which is another  activity you can elect to do Even coming back to our villa it\u0027s perfectly lit And inside is just  immaculate At night I stayed up really late just walking around out here by our pool The nice thing  about your own private pool is it never closes You can always swim even when the main pool does  close The inside of our villa also just looked spectacular We had different lighting modes so you  can decide if you wanted it really bright really dim We also had automatic closing blinds So it  would just close the blinds and offer an amazing view But just look inside our villa It was just  amazing We had this room just how big it is with the two bedrooms It was spectacular Back inside  the villa It\u0027s hard to go to bed because you just want to sit down relax enjoy the atmosphere Look  out at the beautiful pool Look at your beautiful bedroom I mean the lighting alone is an art piece  Just how every little thing is lit so perfectly It really is magical And then with the press of the  button as you can see the blinds are automatically closing and they close to the exact length even  as the uh room bends downward Next up we have the beautiful spa This is the Naira spa experience  here at Njuma and it actually was voted one of the top spas in the whole country It\u0027s definitely  one of the highlights of anyone\u0027s stay and in my opinion it\u0027s one of the most breathtaking spa  experiences in the world This spot is tucked away in the peaceful corner of the reserve It\u0027s  actually more towards the rival area when you first get there by boat It actually was just next  to our villa This sanctuary is purposely designed to reflect both the natural beauty and cultural  richness richness of the Red Sea They have both men and women\u0027s separate changing areas And the  nice part about the spa here is the facilities including steam room sauna and uh like cold plunge  pool are included for all guests And I\u0027ll show you that in a moment We also had the area there  where they have the chair set up for doing hair or nails And then here is the men\u0027s locker room  So if you\u0027re a guest here you can reserve a time It\u0027s included with your stay where you can just  access this locker room And then the facilities The facilities are around the corner here And  this is definitely one of the most amazing spa facilities I\u0027ve ever been in It has the mini  pool there with the ice that drops down in the front It also has an experience shower which I  loved The beautiful tiling that went all the way to the ceiling It had a very large rainfall  shower They had filtered water in there And then here\u0027s the sauna It\u0027s a pretty large sauna I  love that the wood goes all the way to the ceiling And then across the way they also have a steam  room The lockers you get are very personalized They even kind of put my name in one of them  And then you also have robes and slippers You also get access here to the relaxation lounge  where they have some small drinks and a place to just relax in quiet Now this part they\u0027re  still under construction They\u0027re building an outside vitalization pool and that\u0027ll be  open hopefully within the next few months There are five sea-facing treatment rooms and  three open air treatment cabanas All directly influenced by the sound of the waves and natural  light The design is all about the indoor outdoor harmony Every element here from the handmade  ceramic vessels to the woven textiles celebrates local craftsmanship and storytelling What really  sets Naira Spa apart here is the philosophy Treatments are curated like a journey Guests are  encouraged to reflect on their past embrace the present and reawaken to the future Think of it  less like a traditional spa day and more like a transformational ritual Treatments range from  sound healing lunar yoga and guided breath work to deep tissue massage to detoxifying wraps to  all kinds of different facials They also have different treatments here at Naira Spa as well as  the St Reges Spa the sister property and next door and you can get transportation back and forth to  the properties if you want to use the spa at the different resorts Here\u0027s a look at one of the most  unique treatment rooms I\u0027ve seen The tables are actually made of a special stone material Here we  have the other area This is a therapy room This is uh like more of like a couple\u0027s massage area  as it has the two tables right next to each other But every part of this spa is just truly  breathtaking Some have views and then other ones are kind of more inside here This treatment room  also has its own special shower area with stars in the ceiling That is just really special as well as  an experience here in the same room where you can lay down flat and there are jets that come out  in every direction to massage you which is a very interesting experience I was not able to use this  on this trip but I was able to get a tour here of the rooms But every detail is flawless From the  woodwork to the ceilings to the decorations the spa truly has everything you could need Here\u0027s a  quick look at some of the prices and the different treatments here that they had at Najuma Now I  want to walk you through a full spa experience Now we were at the St Regis the next two days  but we actually missed Najuma so much we wanted to go back to experience their spa as I definitely  feel it\u0027s superior to the one at the St Regis Now I was given a locker here They even had my name  a nice robe slippers down below and I basically could just relax here for as long as I wanted We  also could come outside here They have their own little pool here by the spa It\u0027s like a mini  sized pool but it\u0027s nice to just cool off and relax I loved here the relaxation area in the  men\u0027s locker room I\u0027d use the pool steam room sauna experience shower kind of go back and forth  It was quiet relaxing It smelled really good and I just loved the attention to detail It just felt  extremely luxurious in every single way I love the colors the tilings Nothing about it felt cheap  and I was pretty much I was actually the only one there the whole time They try to make it more of  a private experience so they don\u0027t ever want too many guests in here But it was a really nice sauna  as well I love the wood and the lighting It also is a good hot temperature But overall definitely  take advantage of this if you\u0027re staying as it is included for all guests I heard that the facial  treatment of the person I was with went perfectly well She really enjoyed it and had an excellent  experience This is the relaxation after where they brought me some special tea Now just outside  here by the spa they also have this beautiful walkway with all kinds of very nice plants And  they have the little open air kind of cabanas here with some more treatment rooms It\u0027s kind  of like the treatment areas where you can get a massage So that is just amazing The open air  concept with a view Now our boat back to the St Regis was not going to be there for another about  hour or so So after the spa they actually took us here to the beach area in a cabana where we could  just relax The staff was so kind They even made us a yummy berry smoothie They kept checking in  on us bringing us water telling us stories They couldn\u0027t do enough for us Before we left they  also even all signed this leaf and gave it to us as a way of saying thank you and appreciation  The staff here all truly became like family It was already sad enough the day before leaving And then  to come back and leave again it was even more sad We miss everyone so much Finally we want to take a  look at the fitness center It\u0027s not far away from the spa It\u0027s also just beautifully designed with  all the wood tones as well as the hanging ropes Inside you have some small lockers and then you  have the most beautiful view from the treadmills and aerobic machines looking out at the pool the  villas the ocean I even love the wood paneling there in the ceiling It was just so extra They  also did have machines here with the different weights as well as just so many different  options And then the wood flooring was great too They had some refreshing water towels They  even there at the far end had some free weights Finally for the activities we have Galaxia This  is actually all extra charge but they have this venue on property to help organize different  water sports and activities for you Anything from kaying to going out in the ocean I believe  maybe even snorkeling We didn\u0027t even look at the packages cuz we were only here one night so we  didn\u0027t have time but they\u0027re all extra charge but you\u0027ll never run out of things to do at the  property They even can organize other activities here like you can rent out the volleyball courts  although I believe those are free of charge So some activities are paid some are free The main  activity of course is riding the bikes around We definitely took advantage more of this than  anything It\u0027s not only just a nice relaxing thing to do to kind of go check out the property  It also provides great exercise The property is pretty spread out It\u0027s actually many miles from  one end to the other So you can definitely get a good workout in Now here we were at our departure  We got picked up of course by our personal host and escorted away where the boat then took us  over to the St Regis This was definitely not a goodbye but see you again as we really do hope  to visit the property again Make sure to sub to subscribe because you will not want to miss the  next review We are now on the boat heading over to the St Regis That review will be to come next  All right now for the review of the Ritz Carlton Reserve Njuma Start with the rooms Five out of  five insane Whether you\u0027re on the beach or over the water even in even if you\u0027re in their most  basic entry level villa it\u0027s still insane It\u0027s basically still this whole living area we have  here as well as one whole bedroom The difference with this two-bedroom villa is just that we have  that extra room there with the two beds which is awesome for families Next up we\u0027re going to look  at inspiration Extreme five out of five This place is incredible I mean I don\u0027t even know how they  built this Took them three years to build The rooms are perfect I think what they did was they  were like \"We\u0027re going to build the best resort.\" And the cost is not even in the question They  spared no expense I mean every little detail in the rooms the shower even the floor to the resort  grounds the landscaping alone just how beautiful everything is the lighting the Wi-Fi no matter  where you are is just lightning fast I mean I don\u0027t even know how they\u0027ve built a resort like  this It will blow your mind in every single way And you keep noticing new things everywhere you  look The restaurants the staff everyone is just perfect Next up is going to be service Five out of  five Some of the nicest staff in the world Extreme five out of five From the moment we arrived we  have our own guest agent who actually assists us during our stay She came to pick us up She dropped  us off at the restaurants Anytime we need her we just sent her a little WhatsApp message Everyone  gets someone during their stay Here at the St Reges it\u0027s called a butler And here it\u0027s called  like a guest service agent or something like that but they\u0027re here to assist you for anything you  need helping you make reservations But otherwise the breakfast staff were phenomenal Dinner staff  were phenomenal We actually made friends with so many of them And it\u0027s actually really sad right  now to be leaving Even though we were here for just one night it feels like we\u0027ve known a lot  of these staff for a very long time They are all amazing Next finally is going to be value  What I return five out of five Giving this a 20 out of 20 And I\u0027m going to say it\u0027s an extreme  perfect So it\u0027s not just perfect it\u0027s extreme perfect We definitely want to come back maybe  even next March This place is mind-blowing in every way I can\u0027t wait to be back They have uh  outside company here that will actually arrange activities for you like kaying snorkeling We  didn\u0027t even have time to do any of that They have volleyball nets set up We didn\u0027t have  time to do that The spa facilities like the men and women\u0027s locker room has a steam room a  sauna even having like a hot tub that\u0027s included for all guests that stay here We didn\u0027t even  have time to do that There\u0027s so many wonderful things to do They\u0027re always here to assist us in  every single way This is one of the best hotels in the world I highly recommend you add it to  your bucket list Be sure to click the subscribe button below

We \u0027ll prepare a lot. We\u0027re really exhausted, aren\u0027t we? What are youtalking about? This isn\u0027t a bottle. Aquaman.  It\u0027s been a while since I\u0027ve said hello. Today is the grand opening day for the Mush Beach Gangneung Survival Hotel, which is finally opening on the beach. There will be incredibly hot performances and various other events there. This is the Muscle Beach zone. Behind Muscle Beach Signage is a large zone. There\u0027s a CrossFit-like zone for functional training, and then there\u0027s Light Badminton, officially known as Light Tennis. We\u0027ve installed three badminton courts on the beach. Behind that, there\u0027s a weight zone with weight training equipment. The CEO of a company called Yoo-Taek donated all of these to us. They donated about 23 different types, including discs and other equipment. We\u0027re responsible for maintaining them. We\u0027re covering them with lids, but that\u0027s not really useful. Since the air is already salty here, we \u0027ll have no choice but to use the rust. Just a moment, the opening ceremony is five minutes away. It\u0027s an immense honor to be here in such beautiful weather. Now, let me introduce the Baby Ins who are here with us today. First, let me introduce you to Kim Won-seong, CEO of St. John\u0027s Hotel.  Thank you for joining us. [Music] [Applause] It definitely seems good. The most famous Just Funk in our country. [Music] [Music] [Music] My feet hurt so much. [Applause] Ah, anyway, what\u0027s important is that many people came to the event and everyone seemed to enjoy it and it seems to have ended well without any accidents. I\u0027m glad. I was worried about Joseph, but I think it\u0027ll go better than expected and I think I\u0027ve become well-known. Please exercise and have a healthy trip. [Music]"}

thing about today is I\u0027m having a staycation at signal hotel which is at the top of the Lotte Tower so right now I\u0027m actually going to be heading out to the hotel first to drop off my bags there and my hairdresser I booked an appointment at a place that\u0027s just right next to the hotel so then I\u0027m gonna go get my hair cut thank you everybody [Music] beautiful [Music] [Music] we\u0027re gonna need to explore [Music] oh this is the moment we were waiting for oh and then look at that bath though oh wow wow it said hello this is coming out from the bathroom and look at this arched window our bed and over here by the door is this bar [Music] they wrote us a little welcome letter it is our absolute pleasure to welcome you to Signal Seoul the room of course is absolutely beautiful but just on camera it doesn\u0027t do it justice I wish you guys can see how beautiful this room is how why this window is and how amazing the view is Yoshi even these slippers are so nice and actual fluffy with some substance usually Hotel slippers don\u0027t have much to it I just got finished at the gym and I\u0027m in the locker room and I changed it to my bikini and I\u0027m gonna go to the swimming pool and check out the sauna foreign pool we did two different jacuzzis the second one was like 40ish degrees and you had to be completely naked then we also did a steam sauna which was so nice we\u0027re back into our room now and we\u0027re getting changed to go to the lounge downstairs because they have unlimited champagne and sparkling wine and there\u0027s like 45 minutes left of it because yeah we have to rush a little bit but we got changed and I fully had a crisis that I didn\u0027t film I had a top that I brought that I wanted to wear but one of the pieces are missing and I really don\u0027t know where it is like is it even in my house so anyway I threw on this dress let me show you ended up wearing this outfit even though I totally didn\u0027t intend on it but Becca\u0027s telling me it\u0027s okay because there\u0027s not another time I can wear it so now I\u0027m owning it [Music] made it to the lounge cheers this is my little snack like a variety of things they have Brie I\u0027m trying fried seaweed for the very first time actually um not bad I like it [Music] and let\u0027s head up to our room now okay so this is how we get to our hotel room straight out of the elevator we\u0027re gonna go through this way these automatic glass doors don\u0027t know why this hallway is so big and this is our beautiful room [Music] oh my gosh this is the view oh it\u0027s so beautiful we upgraded to see the Riverview at night time and it\u0027s absolutely worth it and so beautiful [Music] foreign this is our Scenic bath got a bath bomb from Lush you\u0027re supposed to have a lot of bubbles but barely any we just spent a really long time trying to take photos of the view and this bathtub because we upgraded for a reason to have this Scenic bath which I mean of course it\u0027s nice to look at in the bath but to capture it on camera is a different story I think we\u0027re just gonna give up now it just doesn\u0027t look that\u0027s nice that is nice I don\u0027t really take baths but it\u0027s a vibe foreign yes hi hello hi can we please order a dish please [Music] finally on the bed it\u0027s been such a long day of taking content it\u0027s been fun they\u0027re so kind they gave us water we\u0027re really thanking them for giving us water and not making us die of thirst I brought some face masks so we\u0027ll be doing that and watching some TV in bed figured since we are here on the 95th floor and we get this beautiful view that I would put on my face mask sitting on the window ledge this room is actually just so nice it\u0027s so spacious I can\u0027t believe that we get to stay here I don\u0027t want to leave the bathroom is so nice too there\u0027s so much space um okay [Music] foreign I\u0027m Really Gonna Miss This room obsessed with this bathroom of course let me turn on the light actually it\u0027s officially time to leave our beautiful hotel room it was a nice day but it\u0027s time to go bye back at the lounge right now just for our last 30 minutes of our stay yesterday I tried this lychee drink it was so good so I\u0027m having it again [Music] so as you saw I had such a wonderful time at signal and it honestly was such an amazing experience but at the same time I can\u0027t help but feel a little bit of sadness too and it\u0027s because I think it\u0027s great that I get to experience all of these amazing things here but I wish my parents could too but I really want to do in life is give my parents and I want to be able to give them experiences but I feel like I can\u0027t and it makes me so sad because my parents being immigrants like it was so hard for them and I just can\u0027t imagine like and what it was like for them because they moved to a brand new country where they didn\u0027t know anyone and couldn\u0027t even speak the language and I just feel like here I am why I get this choice of choosing like what I want to do they never got that choice and for them it was always about survival and I just feel so sad because I want to give them everything like I want I want them to be able to experience all the things that I get to experience but I don\u0027t feel like I\u0027m in a position to do so right now and that\u0027s why I want to work so hard because one of my life goals is to give everything to my parents and that\u0027s also why I feel like I\u0027m such a failure because I feel like I can\u0027t do that right now and then it feels selfish to do these things for myself oh my God I\u0027m sorry these are genuinely the thoughts I have quite a bit and I know I know my parents don\u0027t expect anything at all and they always say like they don\u0027t want anything or need anything but I just want to do it for them I\u0027m sorry for like ugly cry like there are many times since I moved to Korea where I would have similar breakdowns to this because I don\u0027t mean to end this video on such a sad note but like that\u0027s I don\u0027t know like this is these videos are meant to be like a log of my life and that\u0027s and this is really what I\u0027m going through and thinking about anyway I don\u0027t know how to end this video now anyone can relate to this please let me know because this kind of stuff weighs pretty heavy on my heart so but yeah anyway regardless of everything know that you are loved and thank you for following my journey and I\u0027ll see you in my next video bye [Music]"}

{"video_id":"lVDrkHgD1rE","lang":"en","full_text":"Among the three major hotels that opened this year, the one that is hot and new is the one that is the most beautiful and has the best view. We opened a soft one in the Songpa-gu Office building. It feels like a trip to France. What is the Sofitel like and what are the things you should know when making a reservation? Today, I will tell you about it. [Music] Hello, I am a man who has never been there. A similar residency has opened at the Sofitel Ambassador Seoul Hotel in Jamsil, which has a lake view that is hard to find in Seoul. Sofitel is one of the best luxury brands in the Accor global hotel chain that operates 5,100 hotels in 110 countries around the world. It is a hotel that pursues a fence lifestyle and provides a design and food culture that matches it, to the extent that it has 5 books called Soft Lip the French Why. Sofitel is located in the 2nd building of the KT Songpa building in the Songpa-gu Office reorganization, about 300m from Jamsil Station. It is a hotel owned by KT Estate, which has 4 ultraviolet rays in KT, and this lot is an existing phone.  The site where the play was located has been developed, and currently four hotels have opened, with plans to add Le Meridien in Myeongdong in 2022. Now, let\u0027s head to the \"Dead Smoking Hotel.\" Even from afar, the first-floor entrance exudes a flashy presence. Staff members personally open the doors, nicknamed \"Concierge,\" and staff members in traditional Korean attire, including Yeonmi Beop and Gyeoryang Hanbok, help confirm reservations. There\u0027s also a seating area next to the room, which showcases the soft design philosophy of modern yet chic French sensibility. The Forest Frame operates separate guest rooms for the hotel and residences. The hotel lobby itself is smaller than expected. Furthermore, the limited space means it\u0027ll likely be quite crowded on weekends when 3- star guests flock here. Speed ​​Ring offers five types of rooms, two standard rooms and three suites. The most popular ones are the Sean Leif and Pass Kids Suites. The Luxury Lake Room, shown first, is located on the 17th to 30th floors. Among the luxury rooms, this one has a view of Seokchon Lake, numbered 23125. In terms of square meters, it\u0027s a bit small for a basic 5-star hotel room. In fact, the feeling of space upon entering is more important than the number, and the room definitely feels small. I think it\u0027s because the width feels particularly short. However, the room itself is very pretty thanks to the interior that feels neat and chic with a French sensibility. The chevron carpet on the floor, the wax-coated molding on the bedside table, and the unidentifiable door pattern opposite the bed may be 30,000 won, but the color of the room is all unified without any sense of being excessive, showing a moderately restrained and pleasant appearance. However, the best part of the luxury lake room is the view. The sparkling Seokchon Lake and Lotte Tower, the tallest building in Korea, come into view at a glance, and you can even see Lotte World in the distance. Seoul\u0027s sewage itself is precious, and thanks to the tower\u0027s uniquely tailored clothes, it\u0027s a truly special view. I\u0027m especially looking forward to the naked season. In addition to the western Gusu point that I just showed you, all of the rooms have lake views to the left. The south view from Christie\u0027s Suite is 9 crystals, so Lotte Tower is visible from the front, so you can\u0027t see it. Personally, I think the west view with the Omote Tower is prettier. The rest of the views to the east and north are disappointing. The east view from the second floor of the VIP room is blocked by the KT Songpa Building office building, so you can think of it as a view of the building next door. The north view of the standard luxury room faces the Han River, but there are high-rise buildings here and there, so you can only see them here and there when it\u0027s quiet. I\u0027ll explain the room reservation tips in detail later, but for now, I\u0027ll continue with the introduction of the luxury lake room. The bed in the room was given to me by The Bulsa, and I\u0027m using an Ace mattress, and both the mattress and my friend were fine. As expected from a hotel owned by Kinki, there\u0027s a person with a jellyfish bed, which acts as a room control and Bluetooth speaker. There \u0027s a hidden TV with an unknown pattern on the wall that you briefly saw earlier. I wondered if it needed to be mentioned, but for people like me who don\u0027t read tips much, it seems better in terms of interior design than just having a private bathroom. There\u0027s also a small table that\u0027s close by, and they serve as delivery food.  You might think you can eat it, but bringing in outside food is completely prohibited, and a maintenance fee of 33,000 won will be charged if you do. One of the unique things about the Lake Room is that the bathroom sink is outside, and the sink is so pretty. The small business area containing various bathroom supplies also looks like a jewelry box. When you open the chic door that contrasts with the bright sink, you will see the bathroom. Of course, the space is somewhat narrow because the sink is missing. However, the neat bathtub, tiles on the back wall, round mirror, and gold molding make the feeling of smallness quickly forget about the gorgeous and luxurious feel. To the left of the bathtub is the shower room, and to the right is the bathroom. Another unique thing here is that the shampoo, conditioner, and shower gel are not provided individually, but in large reusable containers. This is a bit surprising, but considering the environment, it is the direction we must go in anyway, so I guess we have to accept it. Instead, the body lotion and bean oil are provided separately. It is not the first time I have seen Diptyque amenities in a hotel, but it was the first time I saw Philos Course products used, so it was refreshing and nice. Mini Quick  Located in front of the TV, capsule coffee and tea are provided, and Dilmah products from the Three and Bean tea brand are provided. The Luxury Lake room seemed small at first glance, but the number of implants made the interior of the room very pretty, and even in a basic room without a suit, you can see the most beautiful view in the hotel, so there is no room that you can\u0027t get enough of. However, for those who still need a larger room, I will also show you the suite of 2002 No. 115 Prestige that I stayed in on the second day. After a short study, you can see the bedroom and the 9-minute living room as befitting a suite. As expected, it has the same carpet and wall design as the luxury room. Instead, there is a sofa to watch TV and a round table that can seat four people. In fact, it is the complete opposite first impression from the Eoksori room. The space is a bit cramped, but there is a room inside. Like the living room, it is a spacious bedroom with good lighting, and of course, there is a TV and a TV rim. Next to the room is the North Korean space, and on both sides of the front space, there is a Nojang and a foldable carrier stand. The space inside has a bathroom, but it is also Tweety.  There is only one sink. There is no round mirror, but the design of the bathtub and the back file are the same as the maker\u0027s. The inner shower, Geumgang, and toilet are separated. The difference is that there is no auxiliary toilet in the entrance hall. In fact, it was disappointing that the Prestige Suite, despite being a suite, was no different from a regular room in terms of design elements and amenities. Personally, I like the Luxury Lake Room better because it has a view of the Lotte Tower. The only difference was that the two mini-bar chickens were provided separately and a Sweet Aser welcome letter and candy were provided. Of course, the spacious rooms provide a much more comfortable pitching experience, and another advantage is that it includes access to the Club Lounge on the 30th floor. While we\u0027re on the subject of the lounge, let \u0027s take a look. Club Millesime, located on the 30th floor, the highest floor of the hotel, is a club lounge available to guests staying in the Clone Luxury, Clubman, Peak, or Suite. At the entrance, there is a dedicated concierge for lounge guests. When you check in here, you will receive a purple card key instead of a red key. The stylish interior with a modern feel and various types of seats create an atmosphere. It is as good as any 5-star hotel club lounge, and since it is located on the 30th floor, the highest floor in the hotel, the view is also great. It is open from 7:00 AM to 10:00 PM, and the services provided are divided into breakfast, all-day snacks, afternoon tea, and evening cocktails. It may be hard to believe that the afternoon tea available upon check-in is all you see now. In fact, it is only two kinds of fruit, cookies, and potato chips that are always prepared in the lounge. Happy hour in the evening is divided into 2-for-1 on weekends, but on the weekdays when I visited, it was only open from 5:30 PM to 7:30 PM. I went without dinner, so I was surprised that there was not a single half-and-half menu. There are sandwiches such as brioche, focaccia, jjambbong, bert mani, and bagels, as well as a few breads, olives, nuts, and fruit, and a menu focused on snacks. But when you put them all together, it is more common than you think. Each table is provided with a separate plate of finger food and one per person.  They serve risotto and cool one by one, and the spicy asta coa risotto made with ssamjang and kkaenim pork is really delicious. As for drinks, it\u0027s a club lounge where champagne works for the first time, and Baron de Rothschild root is served in the 2p frame. Both white, red, and No. 4 Pensée wines are available, and nine types of solo drinks are also available. Above all, there are two types of cold second course, Kaki l, which was inspired by the master of French pop, Seul-Jeux Gainsbourg, and the queen of chanson, Edith Piaf. The alcohol also exudes a French sensibility. In conclusion, this person, Kale, ate all the food and drinks provided, so I was very full. However, the bread is the truth to my taste. For those who come quickly, no matter how many menus there are, you can\u0027t go wrong with Haute Couture. Next time I go to Tuscany, I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll include Club Millesime. In fact, I wanted to show you the breakfast, so I had the main breakfast buffet for one night and the lounge breakfast for the other two nights.  We had planned to eat here, but since there were n\u0027t many guests since Pang, we upgraded the lounge breakfast to 2 main breakfast buffets. Anyway, I\u0027ll introduce the popular Pangse-style breakfast buffet for 60,000 won while wandering around. Located on the 4th floor of the hotel, B Pepe Maison offers a great view of Seokchon Lake up close, making it perfect for a refreshing breakfast. True to its name, Pangse Maison, which means \"home-cooked\" or \"home-cooked,\" offers a menu with a Korean-style home-cooked meal concept. Now, the question that arises here is, \"Since it\u0027s a home-cooked meal concept, will there really be a Korean menu?\" Fortunately, there are extreme varieties, including abalone porridge, bulgogi, and grilled pork belly. There are also about 5 side dishes, including pickled seafood in small jars, so you don\u0027t have to worry too much. However, since it\u0027s a Pangse-style home-cooked meal concept, the bakery is the main attraction. There are various types of bread, such as croissants, demi-spicy breads, chocolaty madeleines, etc. Above all, you\u0027ll know once you try them that they\u0027re serious about bread. Among the three types of flour, instead of the pancakes we served, we offer French pancakes, ink wraps, and ink wraps.  The patties are freshly baked and served, and they even have vanilla ice cream on top. I could count the number of waffles that come out with the mua. There are bacon, sausage, ham, Korean meat menu that you saw earlier, raw salmon, and tandoori chicken that you can eat 1, 2, 1, and I kept eating them. However, some of you might think it\u0027s too late just by looking at the bacon on the bread. There are two menus that are good to eat at this timing. First, there\u0027s Tom Yum Goong. I like the real Thai local food noodle dream that\u0027s sour and strong, but I drank Dong Nyang Ggoong that\u0027s a little Koreanized. Next to that, there\u0027s Thai chicken curry. If this doesn\u0027t make you feel too late, you can eat the base prepared with rice noodles in the nude corner. It means Korean, and you can quickly forget about it once you\u0027re late and come back with bread, so I recommend you eat it in the middle. In addition, there\u0027s the consideration of Jangbong that many people like, and you can squeeze juice that comes in a bag. There\u0027s a basic salad with chicken breast, Thai beef, and octopus, and there are 6 kinds of fruit. That\u0027s not all. You can order when you first sit down.  A semi-a la carte menu is also available. You can choose one of three dishes: Eggs Benedict, Ratatouille, Penne toast, and abalone sashimi and steamed eggs. The a la carte menu is plated beautifully, just like what you would order at a restaurant. I didn\u0027t order it, but I liked the second one the most. After using Fem Affection for two days, I thought that there are huge differences in opinions. Since the layer culture plays such a big role in the Fangs culture, I think they are pursuing a strict fast for sushi that is as faithful as overseas. Therefore, if you were expecting a great Korean-style hotel breakfast buffet with an overflowing menu, you may be very disappointed. If you are like me and prefer Western food to Korean food, you can enjoy it as if you were eating breakfast at Hwang\u0027s Travels. However, it is still a bit expensive at 60,000 won, and if you make a reservation by the day before check-in, you can get a discount and eat for 44,000 won, but it is worth it.  I think it\u0027s worth the price. I talked a lot about food today, but it \u0027s not over yet. There are four types of food and beverage establishments in Sofitel. First, there\u0027s the lobby lounge 1 Espace next to the hotel on the 6th floor. This place is famous for its afternoon tea set, which features desserts served on a Ferris wheel, and the clock tower of the Musée d\u0027Orsay in Paris. The visuals, including the beer and the porcelain, are truly top-notch, but the desserts were n\u0027t as special as I thought. There\u0027s a high-end cafe with a view of the green garden in Leicester City. I often look forward to it, but it\u0027s more like a bakery cafe with chocolate and bread as its main dishes. There\u0027s a modern one-night stand fusion restaurant called 5 on the 3rd floor, and my most recommended bar is Latitude 32 on the 32nd floor. The atmosphere is great. The central part of the bar is dark and luxurious with a spacey feel, but it has a Marvel Comics concept, and the bathroom looks like it came straight out of a comic book. In addition, the menu at Kaki is all the same, and the glasses are nice and the visuals are nice. It\u0027s luxurious as expected from a 5-star hotel, but it\u0027s also like a hotel oppa.  It was impressive because it contained trends and location without feeling heavy. Now, let\u0027s take a look at the auxiliary facilities on the 5th floor. First, there is the swimming pool on the 10th and 6th floors. It is located in the southwest corner with the best view of Seokchon Lake, and the 25m long swimming pool is full of emotion with its unique floor tiles and the red walls of the river 11 Palm Son\u0027s * sparkling ceiling lights. Uniquely, there are stairs to the swimming pool, and they are thin, so it would be good for children to come and take a certification shot standing by the window. There are children\u0027s suits at the entrance, and there is an outdoor whirlpool in addition to the chairs. It is a pity that there are only 5 Aman Senior Degas. In particular, the 2 seniors who receive Seokchon Lake seem to be competing at the level of subscription. Instead, there are chairs and cables that you can sit on against the wall. Compared to the director, the fitness center felt somewhat shabby. First of all, the view is a bit northeast, and the space is narrow and the equipment is not diverse. The gym is disappointing. In addition, there is a kids\u0027 lounge and a business corner on the 5th floor, and an outdoor terrace space on the 6th floor.  The view from the hotel is amazing, so I recommend visiting at least once. Also, they return a bicycle to each room at the entrance, and the design of the bicycle and the helmets are very nice. It would be nice to take a walk around Seokchon Lake when the weather is nice. What is the overall review of the Sophie in Phra Tham? It is the best softly among the hotels that opened this year. The Chosun Palace by Marriott, which opened in Yeoksam last May, is definitely comparable to the Sofitel in many ways. First of all, both are brands with Marriott and Corse clothing, and they are located in the Gangnam area and pursue French design. Of course, those who have been to the Chosun Palace know that the Chosun Palace is much more extravagant when considering harmony. It is a look that is determined to show the end of the options, but because of that, there are times when it feels too excessive. The general Sophie definitely feels understated. The overall hotel design pursues French chic, so it is trendy, but it shows a restrained modernity that is not excessive. The space also has a lively sense of space rather than a feeling of being crowded. The Chosun Palace is dignified. If you feel like a king or queen of France, Soft feels like a mischievous princess or prince. Instead, Sofitel uses the remaining energy to create various events and an atmosphere that allows guests to experience the French lifestyle that Sophie Drew pursues, breaking the mold. For example, the staff greets guests regularly, a real hotelier with a fanciful face provides guidance, and a daily French lighting ceremony is held. At first, it was a bit creepy, but gradually, it felt like I was being brainwashed to the point where I thought this was really France. In that sense, after my 2-night, 3-night stay, I really felt like I had gone on a trip. In fact, aside from that, the hotel\u0027s beautiful view and guest room interior are so to my taste that I want to visit again whenever I have the chance. However, there are some downsides. The most recommended luxury lake room is a bit disappointing because it is only 5 minutes long, and there seems to be a problem with the bathroom drainage. Also, if you were expecting a heavy, serious, and grand 5-star hotel next to a young and trendy feel, you might be disappointed. But despite that, Among the hotels that opened in 2021, this is the hotel that I recommend. For those who will be staying at the hotel, here are some tips for reserving rooms. The most recommended luxury lake guesthouse is located on the 13th line from the 17th to the 30th floor, but the western side of the hotel overlaps with the mall for some reason, blocking the view. Not only the view, but the ventilation fan in the cupboard of Lotte World Mall is constantly blowing during the day, so although it is not loud, you can still hear it blowing. Therefore, to secure the view and be away from the ventilation fan, it is recommended to be assigned to a room on the 13th line, which is close to Seokchon Lake and is definitely on a high floor for the optional lake guesthouse. Oh, and if you make a change show reservation rather than a reservation, you can be assigned to a room on the front line. If you want to guarantee a high floor, you can also consider the Club Luxury located on the 15th to 30th floors. Since it includes access to the Aman Club Lounge, the rooms are more expensive and there are many king beds. Also, there are currently no Sofitel rooms.  It is not open yet, but only up to the 26th floor, so please note that even if you reserve a large or luxury room at the moment, you cannot use rooms above the 27th floor. Meanwhile, the Luxury Lake Room and Club Lake Room have beds in opposite directions on the even and odd lines, so if you want to see Seokchon Lake while lying down, you should choose an even or odd room. In other words, the 12 5 line where I stayed is the best in terms of both view and bed room. If there are more than 3 people staying and you need an extra bed, you should book a spacious Mani Peak, but in return, you should choose a clean view. If you can\u0027t give up the view of a large room, you should book a Prestige Set. The Prestige Suite is located on lines 15, 16, and 17, but since the Sofitel building is located closer to the end of Seokchon Lake than you think, the 10 o\u0027clock line may feel closer to a city view than Seokchon Lake. I recommend the Prestige Suite on line 15, which has the best view of Seokchon Lake. But after all, it is the best.  The Opera Suite, a corner room close to Seokchon Lake and with both south and west courtyards, is by far the best in terms of interior design and view.

{"video_id":"dVtHdjD9Clg","lang":"en-US","full_text":"Hi. Welcome to The Westin Josun Seoul, one of the longest running luxury properties in Seoul. The Westin Josun Seoul originally opened as  The Chosun Hotel in 1914 and is iconic for its history. The property has 462 rooms  across 20 floors and is conveniently located in Myeongdong, within walking  distance of many popular attractions. This is the lobby and front desk area. I liked these elevators because they take you to your room’s floor just by tapping your room key - a convenient feature. This is a 1 King Deluxe Guest  Room. On the right is the bathroom. The mirror spans the entire wall which  looks pretty cool. There is a bidet toilet. In the corner, there is a box of  toiletries and a seemingly normal drawer, but it actually swivels open. On the right is the shower/bath tub. The shower  head height is adjustable and can be handheld. There is a robe on the back of the door.  And the most interesting feature in the bathroom is this emergency call button. Hmm… haha. Back by the entryway, there are storage  closets with awkward pins for handles. This closet has a second robe, slippers, an  umbrella, and even a shoe horn which is nice to see - very useful. This is the main part of the  room, there is a TV, work desk, small loveseat, and a king size bed. In the entertainment  center, there is drinkware and Nespresso pods. some snacks and drinks for  purchase, and a mini fridge. Beside the TV is the Nespresso machine  and water bottles without labels. This is our city view. This is the most functional bedside control panel  I have ever seen in a hotel. There are the usual light controls, then climate control which is  rare, and then seven outlets. At that point, I wouldn’t have enough cables to utilize them  all. But they are there if you need them. There is a traditional thermostat on the wall. You can display a red “do not disturb” or a blue “please clean our room” light outside the front door with buttons from inside the room. This is the fitness center, it  is a really big fitness center for a hotel of any size. The free weights  and weight machines are by the entrance. Then there is a seemingly  endless row of cardio machines. Then along the back wall, there are a few  other machines and some inversion machines which is pretty cool to see. There are  towels and chilled water on this wall. This is the indoor pool. The left lane is for  swimming laps and the right is for wading. Off to the side are the pool chairs,  cabanas for rent, and two small jacuzzis. Between the pool and gym, there are sauna  rooms. The property also has a salon and spa. I wasn’t allowed to film in the Westin Club  Lounge, but here are images from The Westin’s website. The Club Lounge is on the 20th and  highest floor of the hotel which offers great views of Seoul’s cityscape. It is open everyday  from 7am to 9pm. They serve breakfast in the morning, snacks and desserts in the afternoon,  and dinner and drinks in the evening. Lounge access can be purchased when booking your  room which usually costs an additional $50 per night. Lounge access is complimentary for  those with Marriott Platinum status or higher. Westin’s Lounge \u0026 Bar on the  1st floor offers afternoon tea and cocktails with a view of a scenic shrine. On the lower level, there is Chosun Deli. Ok. Westin Restaurant Lightning Round. There are five sit-down restaurants; Hong Yuan, a cantonese restaurant, Sushi Cho, a japanese restaurant. The Ninth Gate, an American restaurant. RUBRICA, an Italian restaurant. And Aria, their buffet. Excuse the shakiness, I didn’t have my gimbal at the time. This is the Aria buffet during breakfast. The first station had super unique  pastries. There was a counter around the corner that had toast, bagels, and jams. This island  station has soup, congee, and Korean side dishes. There is a coffee station which always  garners a line, followed by dim sum. I think this end was for udon. This station had American breakfast staples:  french toast, waffles, and pancakes. This end had fried rice, bulgogi, salmon, and tofu.  There was an omelet station, next to that were eggs and breakfast meats. The middle island had an  assortment of fruit, vegetables, yogurts, cereals, juices, cold meats, salad, and pastas. Overall,  an impressive spread. Pro Tip: Complimentary Aria breakfast is a welcome amenity option for  those with Marriott Platinum status or higher. Ok. Something new that I will include in my videos  is a simple rating of the hotel and their value proposition as it allows me to add something  unique to these videos and gives a reference for which to compare future hotels. These ratings are  based entirely on my opinions and experiences, and are subjective as there are no equations involved.  Anyways, I hope you find the ratings helpful. For the room, 4 out of 5 for its cleanliness,  functionality, and comfort. For functionality, recall light and climate control, and an  unusual amount of ports by the bedside, surprising amount of storage, nespresso  machine, advanced toilet, and adjustable shower head. And for comfort, there was  a loveseat which usually aren’t found in baserooms. The only drawback was that the room is  on the small side, coming in at under 400 sq ft. I think The Westin Josun Seoul’s amenities are a  5 out of 5. The property has a picturesque pool, a large gym, sauna, spa, salon, 5 upscale  restaurants, a club lounge, a bar, a deli, a wine shop, and venue space for business  meetings or weddings. The amenities are as plentiful as they are high quality.  So, easy 5 out of 5 in this category. Intangibles consists of location, service, and  any unique factors such as historical significance or styling and decor - the soft product sort-of  speak. The Westin Josun Seoul scores a 5 out of 5 in this category. The location of the property  is ideal, in walking distance to Namsan Tower, popular shopping and dining, historical landmarks,  and a 10 minute bus ride from Seoul Station. The property has a lot of historical significance  as Korea’s oldest luxury hotel. And the customer service is excellent - they helped us hail  taxis which can be difficult for non-Korean residents and Jessie Park secured a salon  reservation even after we checked out. The staff was fluent in English. I know this  is a very American comment, but imagine how inconvenient it would be to stay at a hotel  where you cannot communicate with the staff. Moving on to the cash value.  When we booked for September, room rates were about $200 per night  which I think is an amazing value. When you compare that to some of the lower quality  hotels in America that go for higher rates, this is a no-brainer. Pretty much  a “take my money” kind of deal. The Westin Josun Seoul is a part of Marriott’s  loyalty program which has dynamic pricing for award nights. When we booked, the award  nights were 38,000 to 40,000 Marriott points per night which I think makes for an excellent  redemption. Great point value to be had here. Overall, The Westin Josun Seoul is  a luxury hotel in every regard and offers excellent value when  booking with cash or points. Ok, that is all for my review of The  Westin Josun Seoul. Thanks for joining."}

Okay guys, so this is the passage. Look at just amazing beautiful doors and carpet and beautiful colors. We are in room 1724. So let\u0027s go in and check it out. We are in the entrance now. We are in the entrance and look at this. We\u0027ve got a massive cupboard. Like huge. \u003e\u003e A cupboard. \u003e\u003e So nice. \u003e\u003e So much of space.

And then we have a nice little table for your random stuff that you want to leave on the counter when you come into the room. We also have a huge space for your bags. And there\u0027s a big safe here. And then there\u0027s some slippers down here. And now for the main event. Look at how big this room is. Like it is absolutely massive. We can like run up and down in this room. \u003e\u003e It\u0027s a dream. \u003e\u003e So, we\u0027ve got a massive couch. Going to hear me say the word massive a lot because this is massive. And then what do we have here? We\u0027ve got a nice espresso machine. Beautiful countertop. You\u0027ve got mugs. Espresso mugs. Got some spoons. \u003e\u003e We haven\u0027t seen a spoon in a long time in the in the rooms in Japan. They just give you the wooden muddler to \u003e\u003e be a spoon. \u003e\u003e You can see we\u0027ve been luxury deprived. \u003e\u003e Some drinks if you want. drinks if you want to get lit up. Um, some snacks and chocolates. All of this is obviously not complimentary. And then you\u0027ve got a kettle down here. And on the left hand side, we have a fridge stocked up as well. Not complimentary as well. And this is the view of the room. Just look at this. So big. So we\u0027ve got the couch there. We\u0027ve got a table here. Got a nice comfy chair, a lamp. Another small stool kind of chair. Another bag rack. And we have a nice bedside pedestal, a bed lamp, and let\u0027s see what this is. Okay, so I am guessing that this will be to control. \u003e\u003e Okay, so this is where you can control everything. It\u0027s just like the iPads you get at the Four Season. I\u0027m sure you can order room service on here. and contact the concage etc. Behind here we have Oh, it looks like Oh, it looks like we have automatic curtains. Let me just show you this view. We just got here, so I\u0027m not sure what we\u0027re looking at, but this is some type of crossing. Lots of construction there in the back. And on this side, you\u0027ve got the view of Soul City. So, back to this. That\u0027s obviously for the curtains. And then we\u0027ve got two USB and a normal charging point. And then all your light switches. On that side, we got a lamp and a telephone. Coming into the bathroom. Just look at this bathroom door. I\u0027ve never seen a bathroom door like this in a hotel room. So, it opens up into this huge bathroom. Got a nice big sink. You\u0027ve got tissue box, mirror. You\u0027ve got some amenities here. More amenities there. You\u0027ve got nice lamps on either side. Good lighting in the bathroom. There\u0027s a scale down there. This, I\u0027m assuming, is the toilet. Yes. Wow. Oh, this is a big toilet. Okay, you\u0027ve got the standard Japanese toilet that you get in East Asia. Nice big toilet space. And then we have the shower and a bathtub. Wow. Okay, so there\u0027s a bathtub, big shower, telephone shower, as well as a rain shower. And you\u0027ve got a huge mirror. This is a really big bathroom for hotel standards. Wow. Okay. And that\u0027s the room. Maybe we should do the bed test. That is a good bed. Not too hard, not too soft. It\u0027s just perfect. I think we\u0027re going to be having great sleep. And whilst I\u0027m lying here, I\u0027m looking at the ceiling. And can you see the detail in the ceiling as well? Wow, this room is really, really, really amazing. So, yeah, that is the room tour. What do you think? \u003e\u003e I\u0027m very happy to be in this room. This hotel is stunning. I must say the staff were just jumping to help us. As soon as our foot touched the ground out of the taxi, they were scrambling and like, \"Wow.\" Oh, like I can commend the service in the first minutes. \u003e\u003e We\u0027ve just got here. Like we literally probably here for about half an hour and the service from everyone we interacted with has been absolutely amazing. So yeah, that is the room tour. I hope you liked it. We will take you along and show you the rest of the hotel, but for now, bye from the room. Okay, so there\u0027s one thing I figured out. Check this out. Hey Genie, what time is my checkout? \u003e\u003e 11:00 in the morning. \u003e\u003e How cool is that? Let\u0027s try to turn on the TV. Hey, Genie, turn on the TV. \u003e\u003e Wow, how cool is that? So yeah, there\u0027s also voice control in the room. You can use it for the air conditioner, the curtains, and also ask it the weather and stuff like that. That\u0027s pretty cool if you ask me. Okay guys, it\u0027s a beautiful morning. We are going to go and check out the gym. But first, let\u0027s use this pretty soft shot glass and get some pre-workout in. Let\u0027s go. Okay, we are off to the gym. Look at the lift lobby. Very, very pretty. Okay, this is the lift lobby on the gym floor. It\u0027s very, very pretty as well. And now we are walking towards the gym. Got the men\u0027s changing room. And in here you have the gym. Look at the door. Pretty door. So, as you come into the gym, you\u0027ve got cold towels, some ethanol wipes for wiping down the machine. There\u0027s even some dried banana here. You\u0027ve got sweat towels. And then a water dispenser for hot room temperature cold water as well. And starting here, you\u0027ve got a nice shoulder press, a chest press and chest fly machine. Another chest fly machine. You\u0027ve got a nice leg curl machine. This is all Techno Gym equipment, by the way. And you\u0027ve got a leg extension machine here. And then lat pull down machine. Got a nice little leg press. Got abductors, adductors, and then you\u0027ve got your lat and back machine over there in the corner. And as I said, this is all techno gym, brand new equipment. As we head into this side of the gym, yes, the gym carries on. It\u0027s a very big gym. So we came from back there and now we are here. There is a sitting bicycle. Two of those two steppers stem. Another bicycle. And look at this guys. You\u0027ve got a multiunctional machine here. You\u0027ve actually got a Smith rack in the gym in a hotel gym. That is awesome. We have got training belts, yoga mats, half a bosu ball, some foam rollers, and you\u0027ve got one, two benches, and you\u0027ve got weights up to 22. So, that\u0027s the only downside to this gym. The weights only go up to 22 kgs, which is actually good for a hotel gym, but yeah, it\u0027s just 22 kgs. Then we\u0027ve got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 eight treadmills, two ellipticals, and another bench for doing abs. So, all in all, a really big and well equipped gym, especially by hotel standards. Like, I would give this a five out of five for a hotel gym. So, yeah, let\u0027s get some training done and stop talking. [Music] Okay guys, we just got done. How was that? \u003e\u003e That was a good sesh. This is a very nice gym. \u003e\u003e Very nice. \u003e\u003e Very nice equipment. \u003e\u003e Not too busy as well. That was a good session. Good start to the day. Um, now \u003e\u003e ready for some breakfast. \u003e\u003e Let\u0027s head to breakfast. Okay, first impressions of breakfast. \u003e\u003e I haven\u0027t even seen the breakfast yet, but this room is so beautiful and elegant. Feels like I\u0027m dining somewhere special. So, I\u0027m excited to see what the breakfast has to offer. It\u0027s going to be very like extensive. \u003e\u003e Yeah, it\u0027s very grand and extensive. And the fit outs are amazing. There\u0027s a lot of people here in breakfast, so I\u0027m not going to film right now, but I will come early tomorrow morning and I\u0027ll film everything and show it to you. Okay, so this is the breakfast area and it overlooks the lake in the background. It\u0027s still quite early, so everyone is still sleeping. So, you\u0027ve got a wide selection of food. There\u0027s a dim sum station here. Then we\u0027ve got some soups over here. Got some hash browns, tomatoes, etc. There\u0027s some fish, some bacon, sausages, all the meaty stuff here. Then you have a beautiful noodle station. You\u0027ve got rice noodle, udon, tofu, mushroom, bok choy, and I think you make up your own noodles. And you can just see how big the breakfast area is. It goes all around that way where we are going now. So we\u0027ve got beautiful baking here. There\u0027s a very huge selection of things for breakfast as you can see. And we are just about halfway only. Here we\u0027ve got your condiments. Got your breads and fresh stuff for breakfast as well. I see some salads. There\u0027s some fresh salmon there. Okay. And here I think is the barista. And there\u0027s a whole lot to choose from. There\u0027s some cheeses over here. You have your milks, three types of milk, your cereals. There\u0027s some peanut butter energy balls. Got a nice selection of juices here as well. And you\u0027ve got your water there. And look at this table. And this is all the breakfast area. It\u0027s absolutely massive. And there in the back, it\u0027s a pizza oven, but it\u0027s not for breakfast. And here we have the egg station. So you\u0027ve got some daily meats here. Egg frittata. I don\u0027t know how to say that. Got red bean kiche. We\u0027ve got a chicken. Got some fresh eggs. And this is the omelet station. Can get your omelette cooked here. Good morning. Yeah. So, that is the breakfast area. As you can see, it\u0027s absolutely huge. I\u0027m not sure how many people it seats, but I\u0027m guessing around 300 around there, it looks like. And the finishing is just world class in this hotel. What do you have there? \u003e\u003e Two poached eggs with some very nice either French loaf or some bread, some pineapple and a little egg frittata \u003e\u003e and the green juice. I\u0027ve got a four egg omelette and my naughty plate, peanut butter, mini muffin, a cinnamon donut, a cruffle, whatever that is, a egg frittata just for the veggies to balance the plate out, and a pizza bread cuz that\u0027s just a random thing I was feeling for. But yeah, very, very elaborate breakfast. Lots to choose from, hot and cold. has given a whole noodle station. So yeah, let\u0027s get tucked in. Okay, so this is the lake in front of the hotel. And I don\u0027t know if you can see really clearly from here, but there\u0027s ice on the lake. It\u0027s like - 3 outside. \u003e\u003e And this is the lobby on the fourth floor where you come into your breakfast. Like this hotel is so beautifully fitted out. Every floor looks a bit different to the rest. Uh I think that\u0027s a venue in there. But I love the lift lobbies. It\u0027s so classy, so elegant. It really is like Sopetel really upped its game for this one. Also, look how spacious this lifts are. It\u0027s like a lovely kind of fabric texture, but it\u0027s actually like plastic. You have these golden doors and also detailing on the roof. Very, very cool. Okay, we are now at the swimming pool area and I obviously can\u0027t film too much because there are people in the pool, but I\u0027m going to try and give you an idea of where we are and the space around us. So, we are on the 16th floor and we have the beautiful Shock John Lake in front of us. There\u0027s still ice on it. It\u0027s really cold today. And whilst there\u0027s nobody here, I\u0027m just going to show you. It\u0027s a huge pool. Goes all the way down there. Got some lounges over there. And yeah, it\u0027s quite warm. It\u0027s an indoor pool. And you\u0027ve got some beautiful lights above there as well. And then outside here, we have a whirl pool. It\u0027s really cold outside and there\u0027s people in there as well. So, wa, it\u0027s so cold. Uh, but you have a beautiful deck area here, which I think in the summertime might be amazing. It\u0027s absolutely freezing cold right now. And from here, you kind of get a view of the city. It\u0027s very, very cool. Look at the view. We get the the sun rising behind the mountains. Absolutely beautiful. So behind me there in the corner is the whirlpool. It is heated. So if you fancy coming out in the cold and being in the hot water, then it\u0027s a very cool thing to do here as well. Here as well, we have a little splash pool. I think this is for the kids. And there\u0027s a lifeguard on duty. And then you have the expansive pool which goes right along there overlooking the city. So there you have it. That\u0027s the pool. Beautiful big pool overlooking the city and a great way to start the morning or to wind down in the evening. Once again, the sophetal continues to surprise us. Okay guys, so it\u0027s our last day at the Sopetel, unfortunately. But we woke up to a surprise. Look at this. It is snowing. And it\u0027s a lot of snow. This is all snow. There\u0027s snow on the sidewalks there. And just look at this snow floating around. It\u0027s so cool. \u003e\u003e Okay guys, quickly before we leave the Sopetel, we just want to let you know our final thoughts and how our stay was and our impressions of the hotel. So, \u003e\u003e wow. Um, I wasn\u0027t expecting this level of luxury, service, amenities, uh, the food quality, like everything. \u003e\u003e It really \u003e\u003e surprised me and it exceeded my expectations. I cannot fault anything that would make my stay or our stay better. \u003e\u003e Yeah. And before we carry on, this is not a sponsored review. We paid full price for this. It\u0027s just our opinion and before booking this when we were looking at hotels in Seoul in general, we couldn\u0027t find any reviews and especially English reviews. So hopefully if you\u0027re watching this and you\u0027re trying to make an informed decision on where to stay in Soul, this would help you. But once again, this is not sponsored, so just our opinion. And carrying on from what Lauren said, like we knew we were booking a five-star hotel and it comes with a certain level of service, but to be honest, this surpassed the five-star level for us. We we didn\u0027t expect the staff to be so attentive and so welcoming and there\u0027s also a big staff presence around and they literally fuss over you. \u003e\u003e Yeah. So just to mention it is uh the new year and it started like Sunday. So it\u0027s Monday today. So the hotel was incredibly busy over the weekend and will continue to be so this week and that has not impacted the service and how the staff have been with the influx of people. The standard has remained the same which I think it must definitely be noted. \u003e\u003e So the Korean new year is like a week long holiday. It\u0027s not just one or two days. So, the hotel is very busy, but we were not uh affected by that at all. We\u0027ve got five-star service all along. The breakfast was good. The food menus are good. Obviously, those prices are inflated, but the selection at breakfast was really good. And the best thing about this for me was the gym. Such a clean gym, so well equipped. And just everything was like brand new equipment \u003e\u003e and techno gym equipment. those gym people that know their equipment, like nice equipment and it had everything you could do every kind of workout. You didn\u0027t have to get creative with one dumbbell and a treadmill. \u003e\u003e Yeah. \u003e\u003e Yeah. And all of the fit outs etc were very wellmaintained. Nothing is looks like it\u0027s been run down. This is a fairly new hotel. It\u0027s about 3 years old, but everything is in and span condition. Um, \u003e\u003e the decor is so beautiful. \u003e\u003e It\u0027s just a beautiful \u003e\u003e The room was so beautiful. \u003e\u003e It\u0027s just a very beautiful hotel and I can\u0027t really give a knock to anything to be honest. And \u003e\u003e yeah, even if I\u0027m trying really hard to knock it, it\u0027s it\u0027s very hard to find something. So, that should tell you that we had a really pleasant stay. I love how big and spacious this room was. Uh there are other room categories which you can see online but I\u0027m sure those are very very nice as well. And so now we are going to the best luxury hotel in Seoul like when you search on Google the four season soul comes up. So I\u0027m going to be very interested to compare the standard of service because believe it or not like the standard of service here was absolutely amazing. So, shout out to all the Sophie Cell staff. Every single one of them were very amazing. Always greeted us with a smile and a warm face. And we can\u0027t fault them for anything. We had an amazing stay. I would give this stay like nine out of 10. Like, \u003e\u003e yeah, \u003e\u003e I don\u0027t know, 10 out of 10. Maybe if there was a unicorn or something, but it was an amazing stay. The Wi-Fi was fast, the water pressure was good, the heat in the room works perfectly. and everything was good. So, can\u0027t fault the Sophie tail. We had an amazing time. If you are thinking about staying here, like \u003e\u003e highly recommend, \u003e\u003e highly recommend you do because we can\u0027t fault it at all.

{"video_id":"4NDCCF0zo5E","lang":"en","full_text":"It’s hard to go wrong with a Park Hyatt, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s going to be that exciting either. Hi there, my name is Kevin. This channel came from a love of traveling, a love of the full process and the journey itself. I feature airline trip reports and high end hotel reviews from all over the world. My reviews aren’t sponsored by airlines or hotels so you can be sure to get my unbiased honest opinion. Am I an expert? You can decide. Am I fair? Yea, I am. Let’s get into it, welcome to Seoul. If you’d like to know the exact nightly rate that I paid for my stay or my next five videos in queue, please check out the description below. I just arrived on Air Premia from Saigon and am now heading to check in. While many Park Hyatts are known for their grand spaces, the Park Hyatt Seoul is decidedly understated and discreet- perhaps too much as I think the strangest feature about this property is its entrance. On the ground floor we just have the small drive way and very small elevator lobby which will take you up to the 24th floor where the lobby is. This is common when a hotel needs to share a building, but this hotel, originally opened in 2005, takes up the entire building. When you get off of the elevators on the 24th floor, the top floor, you walk head on into a small reception area that you see here. Attached to the lobby is the lounge named, The Lounge. Serving meals throughout the day and afternoon tea, it is a tastefully decorated but it is quite small. For a Park Hyatt with 184 rooms, I honestly cannot think of why the layout of his hotel is how it is. Let’s quickly talk about the hotel’s location. The Park Hyatt is in the south east of the city, in the eastern part of the famous Gangnam district, but the specific location itself is not exactly bustling. It is directly across the street from the COEX mall and there is an entrance to the Samseong Metro station just in front of the hotel. I’ll hold judgment on the location and say, it’s either a good base to rely on the metro, or you have specific things in the area you plan to visit. So, one thing that I didn’t actually know about the property while I was there was it’s age. All research I do about hotels I do after my stay unless there’s some significant historical story that’s worth knowing. Generally I like to experience a hotel as any typical guest would- not knowing the year it was built or the original designers, which in this case is the Japanese firm, Super Potato who have worked on a litany of hotels in the region for the likes of Park Hyatt, Rosewood, Conrad, Andaz and more. But so anyway, the age. For a hotel that is 18 years old, it’s looking pretty good. Some of the common spaces like the lounge were refreshed during covid, but the rooms look just about the same as when it first opened and they still look really good and dare I say, current. I booked with AMEX Fine Hotels and was offered an upgraded room upon checking in, in this case, bumped up two categories essentially raising the floor and improving the view. Note that, to get to my room on the 15th floor, you would need to go up to the lobby level, change elevators and come back down to floor 15. The layout of the room is a bit odd but I actually kinda like it. The decor inside is simple and the tone of orange wood does date it a little bit, but not as much as I was expecting. Overall, it was a great first impression. A very small detail, but I was happy both sides of the bed had the same controls and also had USB C ports in addition to the universal plug. Generally the curtain and shade controls and often the master switch is only on one side of the bed, which always seemed odd to me. Park Hyatt beds are my favorite beds, so we also know that I slept pretty darn well while I was here. The only silly thing about the layout was that there were no power outlets near the table and chairs, just under the TV. For light sleepers, I’ll point out a sign which is on the table. It essentially says, we are happy to offer you floor to ceiling windows but that means that the noise level is unpredictable and we offer ear plugs on request. I thought this was a smart touch and personally I didn’t find the noise bleed particularly bad, it was just a very low urban hum, quite relaxing to me actually. The mini bar is very thoughtfully stocked, though of course we could do better than plastic water bottles- though at least it’s not Dasani. A pro Nespresso machine was on offer as well as Althaus teas. When I called to ask for two more Nespresso pods I swear my doorbell rang before I hung up the phone. What the service here lacked a bit in warmth it certainly made up for in poise and efficiency. The only annoying bit to me in the room is the closet which has one of the stupid triple sliding doors which means you can never see more than ⅓ of the closet at a time. The bathroom was impressive though. The design throughout the hotel is said to “balance design and luxury in a respectful, low key manner” and I think no place in the room fits that better than in the wet room. I would have guessed just based on the shower and tub area that the hotel was 2 or 3 years old. The fact that this is the original design from 18 years ago is impressive and I think speaks volumes about what Park Hyatt as a brand offers. Whether classic or modern in design, they are all in their own way timeless- or shall we say, more timeless than most hotels. Currently there are 46 Park Hyatt locations with three more opening soon and a few more in the extended pipeline. Park Hyatt is the flagship brand of the World of Hyatt group. Just realizing this as I write now, is in fact the flagship of their Timeless Collection of brands, so at least they are accurate with that one. In the bathroom you’ll find Le Labo Bergamont number 22 bath products. Now of course, given all of this glass, there are plenty of shades to give you privacy. So, beautiful rooms- who’s staying here? My guess is this is a very popular staycation hotel for locals and is convenient for anyone with business in the COEX area, beyond that, Park Hyatts will always attract quite a few World of Hyatt Loyalists. For me personally the only downside of the location is the distance from the airports, taking a solid hour to hour and a half driving. Let’s explore the other facilities on offer, heading first to the indoor pool which is connected by a small lounge area. As with the lobby lounge, I think the leisure facilities again feel quite limited- I think this can be attributed to the age of the hotel and maybe partially excused, but it does exclude the hotel from being a destination of it’s own. Given that, the pool is beautiful, day or night. Heading down from the pool is Citrus. On their website this is actually presented as an F\u0026B venue, but in reality, it’s just a spa refreshment bar, if even that. Time for a beautiful sunset and then another shot that, let’s just say, took me a few takes. I really do love the look of the tower at night and think it has a decidedly modern facade. Ok, time for dinner and the first of three meals we’ll have here, starting at The Timber House. This restaurant and bar is located in the basement and is accessible from the ground floor lobby as well. The Timber House is said to be designed to resemble a post modern Hanok- or traditional Korean wooden house, with Korean wood tiles, patterned sliding doors and other complementing design accents. I generally really really don’t like basement food venues, but I’ve got to say, if it’s gotta be in the basement, this is the way to go. It is comfortable and cozy, warm and inviting and just makes you want to have a seat and sit back while sipping on something amber in color. The food here though, is a bit odd. There are two choices, the Harmony Course, which is a $100 set menu… or, an Izakaya themed Happy Hour menu. Not only do I think these two menus don’t really fit together, I also wish there was more Korean fare on any and all of the menus here in general. That said, the food was very good. I had a sashimi salad and a pork katsu sando on matcha bread- sounded really strange but was a really nice pairing actually. The next morning for breakfast we head to Cornerstone. This is the hotels all day dining venue serving up Italian fare. For breakfast though they put on a beautiful breakfast spread with a small supplemental menu as well. Really one of the better buffets I’ve had in a while, I especially loved the wide array of Korean dishes on offer. New trip, so let’s switch this up a bit. When creating a hotel or flight review, what do you think are some of the most important characteristics about those reviews? To me, to make a truly unbiased review, two things need to be true. First, I need to pay a fare or rate that is publicly available and receive no special treatment or compensation. Second, I need to film anonymously. If I reveal my identity today, that means an airline or a hotel might recognize me tomorrow and lay on the VIP treatment extra thick. I don’t want that. So rest assured that this video today is exactly what I say it is, an unbiased review. And that is why your likes, comments and subscriptions mean so much, they really do help the channel to grow and continue to put out this twice weekly and soon three times weekly content. My patreon is also linked below. And fig jam! One of my favorite things ever, I’ve never seen it at a hotel before. I had to get a piece of toast just to try it. The French Toast was also really good, grilled over charcoal and not too sweet. To work off all of those calories, was the nicely outfitted fitness center, but it along with the pool, was closed all day for cleaning. But, there was no cleaning being done and from my eyes, three different guests who were pretty pissed off that it was locked, with nothing actually being done. Anyway, last up, we have lunch at the Lounge. I chose one of the few Korean items, an Iberico Pork lunch set, from the menu and it was absolutely fantastic. I might not be a fan of the mix of dishes on the menus, but what they serve up they do really well. So, overall, it’s a very nice, buttoned up hotel which gives you everything you’d need, but nothing more- which I do think makes it a bit lacking for a Park Hyatt. Would I come back? Probably not, I’d rather try another place out, but if you need to be in this area, it is certainly a comfortable and delicious place to stay.

because you can reach many of the most famous landmarks in Soul on foot I got to see one of my favorite buildings in Soul the Samsung security building I think it\u0027s such a cool looking building as we got closer to insadong we started to see cool shops that sell various artworks goods and traditional supplies while we were walking around we realized that we had already arrived in iand it\u0027s another hip area with a village atmosphere traditional buildings boutiques restaurants and bars this is one of my favorite areas in Soul you can get lost in the small alley Street and hop into a cute Cafe to try their delicious pastries and coffee and of course take lots of pictures for your Instagram every corner in Ali Street has hidden jams you will love in inundo then we had a fantastic meal at banju banju means a couple of alcoholic drinks with a meal in Korean we started with a unique traditional drink based on sea water then we tried Korean infused beef tartar pork shoulder and Korean style octopus of course we found a bar with such a pretty view of the old part of Soul through a window it was the perfect spot to [Music] unwind the next day we headed to Yo to visit the hund soul it was especially exciting because I grew up in yo as a young boy we had to try so hard not to go bankrupt here then we had to the best Korean barbecues at so hanu barbecue place we don\u0027t have many clips from here because we were busy eating but this is definitely one of the restaurants that we can confidently recommend Charles H bar at Four Season soul is another Jam this place appears in multiple kramas so it felt especially cool to be there in person we started with a complimentary drink and some snacks from the Hat bartender watching them make cocktails was such a fun experience as usual the dry gin martini I had was perfectly [Music] made the espresso Martini was close to Perfection too then we had a blast with our old friends in Ean I hope to have a chance to introduce E1 another time as it\u0027s such a fun place with crazy nighlife that you must visit if you are in Soul the next morning we visited kyungbok Palace or kyong bokun which is also within the walking distance from Four Season Soul built in 1395 it was the largest Royal Palace of the chosen Dynasty serving as the home of the royal family and the seat of government I love kyong bokun because you can experience the time traveling from the 14th to the 21st century just by being [Music] there surrounded by modern sky scrapers this Palace offers a unique glimpse into ancient Korea we saw some many visitors from around the globe dressed in traditional hul which added to the magical [Music] atmosphere this is crazy there\u0027s so many people here but David likes this what do you think about this uh Palace it\u0027s really beautiful I mean it\u0027s like we we\u0027ve seen it on TV we seen replicated on TV but it\u0027s just the scale is so much [Music] more I could recognize the palace where the King used to work because I saw it so many times in the K [Music] dramas the skyscrapers and traffic just outside the walls can seem a world away as you see the palace is a complex of 500 buildings including the throne Hall the king\u0027s living quarters you just saw the palace is like a city inside a city accented by Gardens and Pavilions Scholars estimate that about 3,000 people were living in the palace about 500 of them in including family members and Court ladies were part of the royal [Music] family you can spend hours wandering around resting on a bench seeing free performances and definitely go see kyungu it is one of the most beautiful buildings I\u0027ve ever seen in my life [Music] we then headed to bukon hanuk [Music] Village People actually live in this Village so we needed to be quiet and mindful here it will bring you back to the 18th century architecture with beautiful Han which refers to traditional Korean House architecture [Music] we headed to insadong again as we didn\u0027t get to explore as much the other day these traditional handmade candies consist of 16,000 strings it was just mesmerizing to watch them make it 16,000 [Music] [Music] samji also known as samji street is another place that I highly recommend visiting in inside samil is a colorful shopping and culture complex that features cafes Galleries and workshops that makes modern and traditional Korean Styles this place is great for getting souvenirs and gifts for yourself and loved ones it\u0027s a great place to experience the blend of modern and traditional Korean Styles we then had a decent Korean launch at a restaurant that we on Google the original place that we wanted to go was closed but this place served decent food David especially loved his raw beef Bing Bob also known as UK Bing Bob the next destination was a bustling shopping mecca in Korea which is also within the walking distance from everywhere else that we have visited today it\u0027s a shopping area packed with International fashion brands luxury department stores and homegrown Cosmetics shops is known for its creative street food make sure that you sample some of the street food if you\u0027re in you can have anything from lobster and seafood to pancakes and Fries we went to see a unique show called nanta it\u0027s about a story happening in the kitchen they actually cooked a food during the show so you can can hear and smell them cooking we had one of the best noodles and Korean dumplings also called Mandu at mangon GZA this is a famous restaurant operating since 1966 the cafe Swift was meaningful because it\u0027s run by employees who are deaf so I wanted to support them I loved how cute the interior was as our last destination of the day we visited soul and Tower in the evening this is another landmark that you should visit when you\u0027re in Soul we took the cable car to get to the Tower which has an observation deck restaurants and other attractions the soul and Tower marks the second highest point in Soul the view from the mountain was beautiful we could see the old part of soul in a panoramic view the city was so bright and calm in the evening in case you don\u0027t have time or cannot get the ticket to the observation deck just come to the top of the mountain you can take the cable car and it will give you an equally beautiful view [Music] [Music] we got a carry catcher drone in inadome and we were thrilled with the result the artist captured DAV and me perfectly this is the best I love it so much thank you it\u0027s a Memory that we will cherish forever good morning [Music] so another day begins this beautiful view in Soul don\u0027t want to chase when I\u0027m too out when I\u0027m too this is amazing the next day we started with breakfast at the hotel it was so cool that they kept the ancient ruins from The Chosen Dynasty preserved under the glass floor it felt so amazing to have breakfast at such a historic site then we headed to song to see the Burberry pop-up store song or SSU is a hip neighborhood with a ton of trendy cafes and Flagship stores situated in a former factories and warehouses it\u0027s also called the Brooklyn of Soul because of its hip pip after the popup shop we went to the Dior Cafe and immersed ourselves in luxury you have to make a reservation through the app with the

to check out Grandpa Cafe was absolutely one of our favorites the coffee was tasty and the vibe was super hip we just loved spending time there Cafe derim ch is another place with cool interiors and

{"video_id":"qqc3DioIGrQ","lang":"en","full_text":"Hi. Welcome to Aloft Seoul Gangnam. The property is located in Seoul’s upscale  Gangnam district known for luxury shopping, beauty clinics, and nightlife. Aloft Seoul  Gangnam is directly South of the Han River, less than a mile from Starfield COEX Mall, and  about 2.5 miles from Lotte World Mall. The hotel opened in 2014 and has 188 rooms, including  4 suites, across 15 floors. Aloft hotels are intended to be a budget-friendly version of W  Hotels with bold design and a fun, casual vibe. This is the lobby. The back wall is colorful  and creates an energetic atmosphere especially at night. To the left is a seating area with  equally colorful chairs and couch. Tucked away in the corner near the entrance is an interactive map  and a business center with a computer and printer. Opposite the seating area is the front desk which  is named the Aloha desk. Turning the corner, we have a hallway with elevators, a public bathroom,  and Re:fuel, a hybrid cafe and convenience store. Re:fuel is open daily and serves coffee,  smoothies, chilled soft drinks, wine, snacks, and casual foods like sandwiches and pizza.  Outside is a garden area with tables and chairs. Heading back into the hotel, this is another view  of Re:fuel. On the left is a display of wines and snacks for sale. Heading over to the elevators,  we will go up to the 14th floor for our room tour. This is a Chic River room. Next to the door are  light control buttons and a slot for the room key to power the room. On the right is the bathroom.  There is a single sink vanity and a walk-in shower with a main shower head and a handheld shower  head. Bath products are by Drybar. Lastly, there is an advanced toilet. Opposite the bathroom is  a closet space with robes, clothes hangers, iron, ironing board, shoe horn, and indoor slippers.  Moving the sliding door reveals a counter with a coffee machine, water boiler, and snacks for sale.  The drawers have the New Testament in Korean, a laundry bag, and a safe. Below is some storage  space and a small mini fridge with some drinks for sale and a little space if you want to refrigerate  something. To the right is the bedroom with a TV embedded in the wall, a king sized bed, two night  stands, and a nice cityscape mural above the bed. Along the back wall is a desk, red chair, bench,  and two floor-to-ceiling windows. This is the view of a neighborhood park and the Han River from the  14th floor. Another view of the Chic River room. Two things to point out: the rooms do not have USB  outlets so pack accordingly and per Korean law, hotels with more than 50 rooms cannot provide  free toiletries so dental kits are for sale. Moving down to the 3rd floor we have Re:charge,  the hotel’s gym which is always open. On the left is a rack of dumbbells and some benches.  Along the back wall are ellipticals, stationary bikes, and treadmills. On  the right side are yoga mats and water. This is the 2nd floor which has Tactic, a  conference room, and a public bathroom on the right and a bar and a restaurant on the  left. This is W xyz Bar, a nod to W Hotels, open every evening from 5pm to midnight. Adjacent  to the bar is Artichoke, the property’s restaurant which serves a breakfast buffet, and a la  carte lunch and dinner. The breakfast buffet costs ₩ 27,000 per person or is complimentary for  those with Marriott Platinum status or higher. The breakfast buffet had chilled fruit, pastries,  coffee, juice, salad, cold meats, pickled fruit, pasta, meatballs, eggs, fried rice, pumpkin,  breakfast meats, and the last dish changes daily. Pictured is fried chicken and french fries.  Other days they had fish and beef bulgogi. Ok. Time for ratings. I give the Chic River  room a 3.5. Although the room was on the small side at 258 sq ft, the room was modern,  colorful, had a clean and functional bathroom, comfortable bed and bench, a wall-mounted TV,  and a view of the Han River. I give the amenities a 3. Aloft Seoul Gangnam has a restaurant, W  xyz bar, a cafe, a gym, and two seating areas in the lobby and the garden in back. I give the  intangibles a 3.5. Service was good. Dante, Kacey, and manager Celine were all very friendly and  helpful. The location is kind of a mixed bag as it is in a popular district, Gangnam, but it felt  oddly distant from points of interest because the useful bus stop is across a busy street or just  far enough to make walking a bit inconvenient. Aloft Seoul Gangnam gets an extra intangible  point from me because of its unique, colorful design. I am a big fan of Aloft and W Hotels’  unique styling. Cash prices for the Chic River room are typically $185 per night. At that price,  I give a 3 for cash value which represents some value. I would tell people to consider booking if  they like the modern rooms and the location. The Chic River room is not bookable with Marriott  points so I cannot give a points value rating. However, the base Aloft Urban room can be  booked with Marriott points. This room type is identical in layout to the Chic River room  but is on a lower floor and does not have a view of the Han River. Cash prices for  the base room are usually around $150 per night or 25,000 Marriott points per night.  I give a 3 for cash value and points value which represents some value. For those  with Marriott Platinum status or higher, I would bump those value ratings up to  4 representing good value because of the free daily breakfast buffet for two benefit  which would otherwise cost about $40 per day. In summary, Aloft Seoul Gangnam is a  vibrant hotel in the upscale Gangnam district with a restaurant, a bar, social spaces, and small but modern rooms at a fair price.  Their colorful design and lighting creates a fun, hip environment. Ok. That is all for my review  of Aloft Seoul Gangnam. Thanks for joining."}

{"video_id":"XTZO_TR3qXo","lang":"en","full_text":"One of the world\u0027s hotel chains, Hilton, but it was hard to find a Hilton hotel in Korea, but now, a Hilton button has finally opened in Gangnam, Seoul. Let\u0027s find out together with others about the Hilton Garden Inn Seoul Gangnam, which opened on July 15th. [Music] Hello, I\u0027m a man leaving again. Even those who haven\u0027t been to a Hilton hotel have probably seen the name at least once. It \u0027s a representative global hotel chain along with Hyatt, etc. However, it\u0027s hard to find a Hilton hotel in Korea for different reasons. Even those hotels that aren\u0027t there are luxury or upscale luxury hotels, so it was a shame that there were no 3-4 star mid-range business hotels. But now, there is one. The Hilton Garden Inn Seoul Gangnam has opened in a hurry, just 1 minute away from Yangjae Station, on Gangnam-daero. The reason why the Hilton Garden Inn, which isn\u0027t even a 5-star hotel, is attracting attention is because it has a rooftop pool. It\u0027s almost the only hotel in downtown Gangnam, Seoul with a rooftop pool. The pool is located on the 19th floor, which is accessible by walking one floor from the 18th floor, the highest floor.  It\u0027s located in a very large area, but it\u0027s still long enough to swim back and forth. There\u0027s also a stern to the side, which is great for tanning or sunbathing. There \u0027s also a colorful children\u0027s pool on one side. In fact, before opening, it was announced that only guests staying in family rooms or higher would be able to use the pool, but due to a flood of complaints, the terms and conditions were revised so that all guests can easily use the pool. Instead, it operates under a 117-day system, and guests can use the pool up to 100 times during their stay. Now, let\u0027s check in to the hotel. The hotel lobby has a high ceiling, and the terrier is neatly decorated with a modern feel. While waiting for check-in, there is a sofa in the center of the lobby where you can relax. Of course, there are artworks hanging so you won\u0027t be bored. There was a slight delay in checking in because it was on the open side, but the staff were very friendly and check-in went smoothly. Hill, Garden, and Park Nam-hee have five types of rooms. First, there is the most basic room, the guest room, which is the basic room of a business hotel.  You can think about it. There are double and single family rooms, and they even have a table for one person, so it\u0027s great for families. Deluxe rooms have a king-sized bed and a studio-style double bed with a separate living room and bedroom. In addition, there are Deluxe Suites and Premier Suites. I guess the room that is the most used is the Deluxe Room. When you turn into the room, a small and cozy living room catches your eye. The wooden floor has a Hilton-style feel and is partially covered with cafe-style furniture. There are sofas and cushions that match the colors, but it\u0027s nothing special, but it\u0027s neat and modern. There\u0027s a 50-inch LG TV, and next to it, there\u0027s a small but useful work space. The view is of the 5PC building and villa apartments nearby, and Tower Palace and Note Tower in the distance. I checked every corner of the building, but there did n\u0027t seem to be any particularly pretty ones. I don\u0027t think it would be good to expect much in terms of the view. There\u0027s a ventricle in the inner space, which is 9 meters high. White beads are installed, and there are two side tables and a wooden-toned table that matches the color of the floor. There\u0027s an alarm, and I liked that it has wireless cell phone charging.  The bedroom has a TV, so you can watch dramas from both bed and the living room without missing a thing. The TV also plays YouTube. I hope you check out the fun and informative channels. There\u0027s always a small minibar next to the living room, with a coffee pot, an ice bucket, two tea bags, and Wiley instant coffee. Billy Software Industry. I liked that the refrigerator was neatly organized and not stocked with expensive, unnecessary drinks. There\u0027s also a simple robe and slippers next to it, which I used when going to the pool. The bathroom is next to the entrance. It\u0027s more spacious than I thought, simple, and uncluttered. There\u0027s even a bathtub, but it\u0027s separated from the shower area. My wife\u0027s is there. The culprit is Crabtree \u0026 Evelyn, which is also available on the first floor. There\u0027s no Cheese Sharon. Be careful with the sink. It was interesting that the lighting was installed. The overall feeling of the room is clean and fine. To put it nicely, it\u0027s not a bad thing, but if I introduce myself, it\u0027s a bit different. It\u0027s funny to look for flashy interiors in a business setting. I think there\u0027s no perfect outfit for 4 people. However, considering the space isn\u0027t that big, I wonder if there\u0027s a need for a separate bedroom and living room.  Let\u0027s take a look at the breakfast provided on the 2nd floor. The reason breakfast is important is because it is free for Hilton Honors Gold members and above. As you can see, there are so many Hilton Gold members in Korea that it costs 1 million Gold. If you do n\u0027t have a level 2 or higher, you can use it for 29,000 won. Please be careful about the useless dishes and noodles and udon in the center. The amount of protein on the menu is important, and there are things like Runner\u0027s Bulgogi. There are also a few breads such as waffles and croissants, and there are Korean menus. Personally, I think it has a similar meaning. Compared to the breakfast at the Marriott-affiliated Waterfall Yeonchi, which is the most recently opened Four Points Myeongdong, the variety and taste were disappointing. I, one of the 1 million Gold members, ate it for free, but I think it\u0027s a bit much to pay 29,000 won. Garum Bistro operates for lunch and dinner, but it is said that it will not operate late in the evening during the Level 4 social distancing period. The hotel\u0027s 4 dining rooms are located on the 1st floor lobby.  There\u0027s another cafe in the 3rd floor that feels like a bar. It\u0027s bright and well-lit, and feels like a cafe. They only sell drinks before 5 p.m. Next to the lobby check-in counter is The Shop, a 24-hour, 5-person convenience concept. They usually have mini bars in the guest rooms, as well as alcoholic beverages and snacks. An adult toothbrush costs 4,000 won, a Sung toothpaste costs 5,000 won, and a Gillette razor costs 11,000 won. Hmm, I didn\u0027t accidentally bring anything, but I bought two for 900 won at the first counter right next to the port. You can pick up ice at the bar shop, so you can bring the ice bucket from your room and take it yourself. There\u0027s a fitness center on the 18th floor. It\u0027s a luxury techno gym with two treadmills, a rowing machine, a cycle, cables, kettlebells, and dumbbells. Of course, the equipment is a bit disappointing, but this isn\u0027t the end of Osan. There\u0027s a business hotel, right? Q is also really great, and I think they put a lot of effort into it. There\u0027s a coin laundry and a conference room on the basement level. For your information.  Parking is only valet, and the parking fee is 10,000 won per day, including valet, but please note that you have to pay 10,000 won each time you leave. Then, what is your overall review of the Hilton Garden Inn Gangnam? I\u0027m really thankful that a Hilton chain hotel of this level has opened in Gangnam. Above all, I highly value the fact that it has a rooftop pool, even though it\u0027s not as big as before. At least from June to September, when the outdoor pool is available, I think Russell has a really big advantage. The price is about 100,000 won on weekends during peak season and 100,000 won on weekdays during off-season. Considering that it\u0027s in Gangnam, the price isn\u0027t bad. There are hotels in Gangnam that are comparable to hotels in Gangnam. And above all, for a million Hilton Gold member like me, it\u0027s a hotel like a dam-bi. Even after putting in all my Gold, the only places worth going in the metropolitan area are the very expensive Conrad and the very old Millennium Hilton, so there\u0027s no chance of receiving Gold benefits, and it\u0027s just guessing to maintain membership level.  Even though there were too many choices, I think it\u0027s a welcome change that there are now more choices and that a cheaper option has been added.

So, make  sure you stay to the end so you can hear the review of this hotel. And if you\u0027re new  here, welcome. Please don\u0027t forget to hit the subscribe button and the notification  bell. And if you\u0027re returning subscriber, thank you so much. I truly appreciate  it. Now, let\u0027s get into this hotel tour. First up, let me take you on a tour of room 2606  where we\u0027ll be staying in Seoul, South Korea. Its me. What\u0027s in here? Fire extinguisher. Okay, that\u0027s all that\u0027s in there is fire  extinguisher. Safety first, I guess. Closet. Safe. Slippers. Nice mirror. Bathroom. This is a way better shower. It has where you can  stand under the shower. And it has a door. So, that\u0027s nice. I have curtains again. It doesn\u0027t  have Oh, wait. It does have a bidet. What is on the side? All those things. TV doesn\u0027t  look too bad. Why does it say 90? What? Not sure what\u0027s going on  there. And then the bed. TV. Smaller TV. Fridge over there.  What is this? Does this open? Oh, what? Coffee, tea, stuff. Charging ports.  And then what does it look like outside? Oh my gosh. That is a nice view. Get a view of Seoul.  There\u0027s a train. Yeah, train going down there. Do you have any traffic? Yep. Right there. There\u0027s  some traffic there. Oh, wow. That\u0027s terrible. Now, let me take you on a tour of the rest of the  hotel. Taxi drop off. When you get dropped off by a taxi, you come onto this level and  then you go up to the 19th floor to check in. So behind me is the Eatery. Um their restaurant  where they have breakfast, dinner, lunch and dinner, but they could have special events  there and they\u0027re not going to let you know um until there actually is event and you try to  go to the restaurant. So that can be kind of an inconvenience. But in front they have this deli  for grab and go. But these are things you have to cook which is not easy to do. They don\u0027t  have like any snacks like chips or anything here. They do have free bottles of water. They  give you water in your room, but then they also have a fridge with water by the front desk. So  on the 20th floor, you\u0027ll find a seminar room. And then if you keep going, there\u0027s  actually a laundry room and a fitness center. Here is the laundry room.  It\u0027s open from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. the laundry room. You can get detergent and things out  of the vending machine. And there\u0027s a TV in here for you to wait.  Now we keep going. And here is fitness center. No one is in here. They have  some of these bikes. They have treadmills. Nice mat area. Mirrors all the way  around. We have a bench. Weights. Never give up. some of the stability balls, more water, towels. Finally, on each floor, you\u0027ll  have a water refill station, which is great, so you don\u0027t have to keep wasting plastic water  bottles, and a microwave and ironing board. Now, let\u0027s head back downstairs to go around outside.  So, those are just some things by the hotel. I\u0027m walking around to the like main entrance of the  hotel, but also near the hotel is Seoul Station, which has a lot of different bus routes going  through there as well as subway Metro Station. Um, so it\u0027s very convenient. There\u0027s actually  entrance to it in the hotel, which I\u0027ll show you in just a moment. Let\u0027s go around to the  main entrance of the hotel. The streets throughout the entire city are very busy. It\u0027s nothing  like I\u0027ve seen anywhere back home in the US. Um, I feel like it\u0027s Atlanta drivers mixed in New  York City, but not enough people take the subway. It\u0027s just crazy. You definitely have to plan  ahead because traffic, you will be sitting in the car thinking it\u0027s going to be 10 minutes  and you\u0027re really in it for 30, 40 minutes. Here\u0027s the Four Points by  Sheraton. And this is the building. Go to the subway. You come off the  elevator turn to the right or left. And then you come right out here. You\u0027re going to turn and just go. Just keep going that way. You\u0027ll  just run into the Seoul subway station. And when you come back, you\u0027ll see these signs right  here um to lead you to it. And you\u0027ll see other signs for Four Points by Sheraton. Okay, so  that is all for the tour of the Four Points by Sheraton at Seoul Station. Has everything  you need in it, but it\u0027s not as accessible or um convenient because you don\u0027t have any space  in your room to even have like an ironing board, steamer, or anything like that. I do like the  bathroom, but the bathroom is kind of dim. So, that can be a problem if you need more light to  see. Also, they do have a refrigerator in room, which is cool, but no microwave in the room. So,  you do have to go out to the community microwave, which they do have on every floor. I highly  recommend not staying on the 20th floor because there\u0027s going to be a lot more foot traffic with  the laundry room and the exercise room on that floor. Also, do not depend on the restaurant  because you don\u0027t know if it will be shut down for a private event until you try to go to it. And  uh make sure you bring snacks because they don\u0027t have snacks in the hotel. They do have, you know,  you can always go to a convenience store nearby, but sometimes you\u0027re tired and you don\u0027t want to  deal with that and you aren\u0027t prepared for it. And also make sure you go to the right Four Points  hotel. There\u0027s a lot of Four Points by Sheraton hotels here. And the first one we went to had just  a slightly different name in it. I think this is Josun. Another one we went to was Myeongdong.  But everything else in the name was the same. So, we ended up going there first and then had to  take another Uber 15 minutes to this hotel, which I wish we were in that hotel because it  smelled better. It looked better. It just was all the things. But here we are. I don\u0027t know if  I would stay here again due to the convenience of location and convenience of the amenities  within the hotel. Hope you enjoyed this tour. If you enjoyed this tour, please make sure you hit  the like button. Please don\u0027t forget to subscribe and hit the notification bell. it is free for you  to do so.

{"video_id":"EiE4uZpHwdY","lang":"en","full_text":"Suite rooms are a bit bigger and have fancy interiors, but isn\u0027t that the only difference? Even professional hotel reviewers are surprised by the difference between basic rooms and suites at 5-star hotels in Gangnam. Let\u0027s find out with Again Departure. [Music] Hello, or this is Again Departure. The best thing about writing a hotel review is showing you all the hotel rooms by type. Since I\u0027m not rich, I don\u0027t have the time or money to book all the rooms. Thankfully, the Grand InterContinental Seoul Parnas, a representative 5-star hotel in Gangnam, invited Again Departure. Thanks to you, I\u0027m going to show you all 10 types of rooms at the Grand InterContinental Seoul Parnas for the first time in Korea. Please pay close attention to find out what makes a good room different. The 10 types of rooms at the Grand InterContinental Seoul Parnas are largely divided into regular rooms and suites. Deluxe and Junior Suites are regular rooms, and the rest are suites. Rooms are also divided depending on whether they include access to the club lounge. Deluxe and Junior Suites  You can choose from suites with and without, and all the remaining suites include access to the club lounge, so the room name has the word \"club\" in front of it. This is the deluxe room of the Gibong room. It is relatively large for a basic room of the same class hotel at 40 square meters. It was renovated in December of last year, so the interior is very clean. The bed is a Beautyrest blue As line made in collaboration with Simos. There are two types of room views: Bongeunsa Biwa and Born Oryu. There is a long sofa next to the window to enjoy the view, and there is also a small table, which is nice. There is also a small but useful work space opposite the bed. There are as many as six Nespresso coffee capsules in Mini Parody, and TVN clothes that are parodied in Non are also prepared. The bathroom is at the entrance to the room, but there is only one sink, and Jo Malone I Men Parody is provided. The bathtub and shower are located near the toilet in a space separated by a separate translucent door. As you can see, the deluxe room has one king bed. There are rooms, but there are also single bed twin rooms and double bed twin rooms. A room that is one level higher than the deluxe is the junior suite. Usually, suites have separate bedrooms and living rooms, but when the bedroom and living room are separate but not completely separated, it is called a junior suite. Unlike the deluxe room, there is a sofa and a desk that are large enough for two people to sit on as soon as you enter. The work space is also much larger and more independent by the window, so it would be good to use when traveling on business or working from home. There is also a TV in each of the living room and bedroom. Although the living room and bedroom are not completely separated by a door, there is a wall that half blocks the space between them. Nevertheless, the deluxe is also 1.5 times larger, so there is definitely no armchair to play with. The junior suite also has rooms with two single beds or two w. Please note that the T-Max is a complete studio 0 room with no wall dividing the living room and bedroom, so the bathroom is also much larger than the deluxe room, but the difference is that you can enter from both the bedroom and the entrance to the room. Unlike the deluxe room, there is a separate shower space, and the bathtub is outside.  It\u0027s outside, so you can take a bath without feeling stuffy. In the case of the weapon, there\u0027s also a separate bathroom outside. It\u0027s different because there\u0027s a separate closet space between the guest room and the bathroom. The mini laundry is also changed to Steven Smith from the Junior Suite. You\u0027ve seen the regular rooms so far, and now we\u0027ll move on to the suite. The most basic is the Sweeting Club InterContinental Suite. It\u0027s the same size as the Junior Suite, 60 square meters. But as you can see, unlike the Junior Suite, the living room and bedroom are completely separated by a wall. The sofa has also been changed to a turquoise sofa inspired by traditional Korean celadon from the Suite, and it\u0027s a bit bigger. The round table design has also changed by 1 depth. Inside, there\u0027s a ventricle, and starting from the Club InterContinental Suite, you\u0027ll find a CBT rest, a recent class product. In fact, the bedroom feels a bit narrower than the Junior Suite, but that\u0027s because there\u0027s a closet space between the bedroom and the living room to store your luggage. And here, an LG Styler is installed. The bathroom structure is also a bit different, as you can only enter through the bedroom, and the toilet is also inside the bathroom. Other than that, it\u0027s similar to the Junior Suite, one level higher. Maps with  The Club Grand Suite is my favorite room and the one I highly recommend. Above all, this room is 4m tall and has a friend on it. Excluding the two best suites that only require one night\u0027s stay, this is a room with a friend on it, and it is one of only three rooms in the hotel. To maximize the effect of the friend on the friend, it is a Studio 0 room that does not separate the bedroom and living room, but rather has a spacious feel, making it look much larger and more luxurious than a Junior Suite or Club Content Suite, even though it is the same size. There is only one TV in the Studio 0 room, but fortunately, it can be rotated, so you can watch it comfortably from the bed or sofa without worrying about the view. Other than that, the furniture, work space, and minibar are the same as the Club Intercontinental Suite. However, starting with the Club Grand Suite, there is a time when a part-timer is placed under the bed. The bathroom also looks much more spacious due to the high ceiling. From this point on, Hermes amenities are used instead of Jo Malone amenities. It is not Hermes, but it is unique. However, it is an LG Styler.  It\u0027s a bit disappointing that it\u0027s missing. Then, starting from the Executive Suite, the room rates are definitely cheaper. The room size is 75 square meters, which is much larger than the previous rooms. Thanks to this, when you enter the room, the living room is not right away, but there is a separate entrance and a pretty mirror. The floor color has also changed. The cinnamon-colored red floor of the Executive Suite stands out, and to match it, the sofa is a luxurious red, and the hanging paintings are decorated to match the color. Above all, it\u0027s not a club, but the Executive Suite has a three-bay structure where the living room, bedroom, and bathroom are all located by the window. Thanks to this, it looks overwhelmingly spacious and the space is also spacious. Another big thing is that, starting from the Executive Suite, instead of a regular Bluetooth speaker, a high-end Loudspeaker worth over 1 million won is installed. You can connect it to Bluetooth or listen to the provided CD. The entrance to the bedroom has a high-quality stand that matches the color of the bed. If you go down a fairly long hallway, you will find the bedroom. Then, the footrest of my bed makes the bed look bigger. Next to the bed, there is a closet space and, of course, a Styler. By the window.  The bathroom, which is located next to the sunbed, feels much brighter with the sunbed in it, and the bathtub is separate from the space next to the raised window, instead of being a memo pad, creating a much more romantic atmosphere. The Club\u0027s Executive Suite is also equipped with a separate bathroom next to the living room, in addition to this song. However, Jo Malone soap is prepared instead of Hermes in the sub-virtual city. The Club Corner Suite, the highest grade among the mid-level suites, is a room with a third-rate bay structure and good lighting, measuring 85 square meters. The interior is almost identical to the Club Executive Suite, and the bedroom structure and furniture are almost identical to the Club Executive, but it definitely feels a little more spacious. In fact, the Club 2nd Executive Suite and the Club Corner Suite are almost similar with only slight structural differences, so you can choose according to your preference. The rooms I\u0027m introducing from now on are two types of suites that are difficult for the general public to ask about, ranging from several million won to over 10 million won per night. First is the Club Ambassador Sweat. It\u0027s a cool room right from the entrance.  The room name is engraved on it. The room is large enough to fit a 10-inch and M Junior Nursing Room, and its height is impressive with its enormous space. In the living room, there is a large sofa as well as a luxurious round table. There is a dining space in the back where six people can eat at the same time. The lighting is different from the general rooms, and two types of luxurious lighting brighten the living room. The TV is a 65-inch OLED TV. The floor is also made of natural wood, which is more hygienic. The main furniture is carpeted only when it is in the kitchen, so it has a high-end feel. Next to the dining table, there is a kitchen where you can cook simple meals. There is an LG refrigerator and a 5-inch highlighter, and there is a separate bathroom for visitors on the other side. This time, it is equipped with an LMS Dino. After passing the living room, you will find the ventricle. As expected, the 3V structure faces the entire guest room window, so it is almost really nice. The blue bed footrest, which is a strong point, is much larger as the space is wide. On one side of the bedroom, there is a bathroom the size of a regular bathroom.  There is a closet. There is a bathroom inside the bedroom. The bedroom, living room, and bathroom are separated by a real door, but it was nice that it was translucent so it didn\u0027t feel stuffy. The circular sofa in the bathroom is an impressive entrance, and the sink, unlike other dog shows, is made of beige marble. There is also a TV for 6 weeks, so you can watch TV while bathing, and it is a Tri-Did product. Now, this is the last one. It is the Presidential Suite for VVIPs, the ultimate 5-star hotel suite. When you enter the room, you may be confused because it is not a hotel room but a hallway. It is 303 square meters, more than 5 times the size of the Ambassador Suite A that you saw before. Come on, it is clearly divided into three directions like this. If you go under and to the left, you will find the living room. I thought the living room in the suite was big in M ​​earlier, but the living room in the Penn Station Suite is big enough for most romantic dates. There is a beige sofa, chairs, and two round tables. Above all, the velvet accent chair stands out. It has a DVD player sized 5, 7, and 17 inches. It\u0027s an OLED TV. Audio wise, how about the 5 million won R7 model? The dining table is large enough to seat eight people at once, and to the side is a dark marble-decorated dining table. Inside, there\u0027s a kitchenette, though not quite large, with a double-sided refrigerator and a wine cellar filled with high-end products. As this is a space frequented by 9-pin guests, there\u0027s a separate study off the living room. The desk and stand are clearly visible, and the special attention to detail is evident. Returning to the central hallway, there\u0027s a separate closet in the middle for visitors\u0027 clothes. Next to it is a visitor\u0027s bathroom, which is even more luxurious than most restaurant bathrooms. The lighting is dim, the powder room is separate from the sink, and since North Korean bathrooms are located inside, it seems there\u0027s no problem using the bathroom even if many people visit the room. To the right of the central hallway, there\u0027s a private space for guests. Above all, the square frame above the bed in the bedroom is a special feature. Not only the frame, but also the mattress is a top-of-the-line CMOS Beautyrest Black Silver Ni. There\u0027s a separate TV in the bedroom, and the bed is also equipped with a separate TV.  Opposite the back entrance, there is a space with a mirror and table that is perfect for my taste. There is a bathroom inside the bedroom. Bongeunsa Temple B can be seen from the bathroom, but since the room is so spacious, the living room and bedroom bathroom are different. Across from here, there is a Stylist closet, which is spacious enough to fit most household items. The highlight of the pension suite is, without a doubt, the treatment room and sauna located at the innermost part. The room is equipped with an awning machine, simple exercise equipment, and a yogurt mat, so you can exercise without worrying about other people\u0027s eyes. There is even a Finnish-style dry sauna, so this is perfect. In fact, while filming at the Grand InterContinental Seoul Parnas, my hope was that this video would be helpful for those who need to fully understand the entire hotel and use it. In that sense, let\u0027s take a quick look at the hotel\u0027s restaurants and facilities. These days, many people book rooms that include access to the club lounge and take care of everything in the hotel, or they often have a hot spring bath. In fact, among hotels in Gangnam that include lounge access, the Grand InterContinental is by far the best.  The food is good. On the 34th floor, Club InterContinental offers a total of four services: afternoon tea, cocktail hour, club breakfast, and refreshment. Many places have lost the three-tiered afternoon tea tray these days, but this place still offers a generous dessert menu and a tower service. The cocktail hour is great because they serve main dishes that can be ordered at the table, as well as buffet food. Usually, two menus are provided: meat and fish. In addition, there are many foods worth eating, and since they make the food right in front of you, you can eat and drink to your heart\u0027s content. In addition to the meals provided in the form of breakfast, you can choose from a game menu. I really like that steak is served in the morning. In addition, simple cookies and refreshments are provided. However, some people only look forward to breakfast when they go to a hotel. For those people, you can use the Grand Kitchen on the first floor. Just like the famous DPM, they have a variety of dishes, and I like that they prepare morning steak. There is a wide variety of breads and many Korean menus, so there is something for various tastes.  I\u0027m a perfect sister who can satisfy you. In addition to the breakfast restaurant, there is the famous Chinese restaurant Why Iru and the Hakone restaurant. The Chinese restaurant Why Iru located on the 34th floor of the U Zone is decorated in intense red and blue and serves special duck that the head chef Yang Soo personally carves. It is said that the duck was dried by continuously coating it with vinegar and starch syrup for five days straight. The Beijing Why three-course menu, champagne pint as an aperitif, and the weekend set menu including the meal and dessert are very filling and delicious. The Eun restaurant Hako Noe located on the first floor is famous for its special monochrome raising to help you recover your energy in the summer. The pretty owner personally prepares the most confident menu with various seafood such as croaker and sea bream, as well as beef. The pot rice is especially delicious. It would be good to visit if you need to replenish your energy before Boknal or if you feel the mood of the important concept. In addition, the lobby lounge on the first floor is my favorite central hotel lounge, so I watched the hotel shaved ice video and the afternoon tea video.  I\u0027ve introduced it several times, so please refer to it. You ca n\u0027t miss the bakery Grand Deli next to the lounge. The auxiliary facilities include the Metropolitan Fitting Health Club. You can exercise by getting water at COEX. The equipment is not the latest, but compared to other 5-tepee tennis clubs, it is well-equipped with free weights such as squat machines and benches rather than machines, so I think it may be better for those who exercise a lot. The swimming pool is not a swimming pool with a lot of emotion, but a swimming pool for swimming. We\u0027ve looked at all the rooms of the Grand InterContinental Seoul Parnas, all the FM closets, and auxiliary facilities. In fact, it costs a lot of money to buy a bun. I hope you thoroughly check out all the rooms, lounge, auxiliary facilities, and restaurants that I showed you today and make a reasonable decision. If you found the video about money helpful, please subscribe and like. Then, I\u0027ve gained a man who left again until now. Thank you. [Music]"}

The beige-toned living room is bright and warm accented with gold tones for an upscale look. Decorated with Korean ceramics and props for a touch of Korean beauty. The unique chandelier stands out. A hotel\u0027s chandelier often shows how much care has gone into a room. True to Lotte\u0027s top suites, every space has unique and luxurious chandeliers.

Lotte Hotel Executive Tower is not only famous among state guests but also well-known among staycation enthusiasts. Unmatched \u0027stay \u0026 dine\u0027 experience It\u0027s known for top-notch dining lounges. I praised \u0027Le Salon\u0027 two years ago with my own paid-for review video. While others cut lounge services Lotte Hotel Seoul opens \u0027La Cime\u0027 upping their service game. Unlike \u0027Le Salon\u0027 on the 16th floor the new \u0027La Cime\u0027 is on the top floor situated on the 34th floor. Its name \u0027La Cime\u0027 means \u0027the top\u0027 in French, fitting its location. Entering \u0027La Cime\u0027, you\u0027re greeted with luxurious gold tones and patterns featuring artist Park Sun-ki\u0027s work. An art of charcoal signifying purification. \u0027La Cime\u0027s\u0027 entry offers an open view. View Euljiro and Gwanghwamun\u0027s skylines and distant Inwangsan through one window. Namsan feels close through the opposite. Lotte wasn\u0027t known for Namsan views but now, it\u0027s a top pick for many views of Namsan from high floors are stunningly close and impressive. \u0027La Cime\u0027, like \u0027Le Salon\u0027, has touches of Korean design that\u0027s welcoming. Modern lighting and private room spaces A lounge fitting for top-tier guests exuding luxury and sophistication. \u0027La Cime\u0027 excels in its food offerings worthy of Korea\u0027s top hotel title. Offering afternoon tea, happy hour, and breakfast three times of service provided. Afternoon tea available post-check-in with a two-tiered tray of scones and various desserts served with tea. Desserts are as tasty as they look. Beyond the tray, macarons and cookies and rare date palms are also offered. Enjoy these with \u0027La Cime\u0027 special latte. Enough to be a full meal with desserts alone. Happy hour after 6 PM provides quality variety reminiscent of \u0027La Seine\u0027 with a range of high-quality dishes. The meat quality is especially important. Unbelievably high standard for lounge with quality lamb and tenderloin steaks ready. Beyond meat, a full spread of hot food including pasta and shrimp dishes. On the other side, salmon and cheese salad a variety of cold cuts are available. For dessert, various breads and cakes plus macarons and fruit are prepared. You see why it\u0027s top for \u0027eat-cations\u0027. \u0027La Cime\u0027 also features a central bar. With cocktails crafted by experts the signature cocktails are memorable. During happy hour, table service with finger food and signature drinks. \u0027Mugunghwa\u0027s Sunset\u0027 filled with Seoul\u0027s glow and a drink inspired by the refreshing waterfall show \u0027Deep Island\u0027 offered at the Peninsula Lounge on the first floor. Champagne \u0027Le Marquis de Marillac Brut\u0027 various wines and whiskeys ready for you with finely prepared round ice balls. Breakfast as diverse as the happy hour. Hearty meat dishes even in the morning made-to-order egg dishes and yoghurt, desserts, and fruit. Lounge breakfasts are often simple but at Lotte\u0027s \u0027La Cime\u0027 and \u0027Le Salon\u0027 you can experience a full breakfast buffet. Beyond tea/happy hour/breakfast at \u0027La Cime\u0027 enjoy a cup of tea anytime perfect for a view-savoring visit. \u0027La Cime\u0027 exclusive to Premier rooms and guests of higher suite rooms ensuring a relaxed, uncrowded experience a significant advantage for a food vacation. After watching today\u0027s video many of you may want to visit \u0027La Cime\u0027. To help with your booking I\u0027ll briefly introduce rooms with access. Premier Room is the most popular accommodation at Lotte Hotel Executive Tower. It offers  a vacation experience at the most reasonable price providing a more spacious area than the Grand Deluxe rooms, similar to the generous space of a junior suite in many hotels. Unique lilac rooms, thanks to trendy hues perfect for bridal showers and staycations capture bright, luxurious photos with ease. Junior suites have separate living/bedrooms. Junior suites: Ideal for events like proposals. It\u0027s just the right size for celebrations. Rooms facing the city, with a view of Gwanghwamun Deluxe and Premier suites offer similar layouts with the structure same as junior suites. Deluxe suites boast Namsan Mountain views ideal for those who wish to see Namsan. Premier suites have larger living spaces for those who value living room activities perfect for movies or time with friends great for guests using the living room more plus an extra restroom apart from the main one. The Charlotte Suite rivals top hotel suites It\u0027s a vast suite with a luxurious feel. It has been used several times as a filming location for actor and model photo shoots, artist interviews, and more. Living room fitted with sofa and table a separate bar like in the Royal Suite Charlotte Suite also features this bar. Bedroom with refreshing colors and furniture and warm bedding and wall lights complement well offers luxury and distinct room design.

{"video_id":"Tz6SWpmr_9w","lang":"en-US","full_text":"Yeah… I’m pretty sure no one  actually swims in this pool. Hi. Welcome to JW Marriott Dongdaemun  Square Seoul. This property is under Marriott’s flagship brand, JW  Marriott, and is located across the street from Heunginjimun which is a  restored gate of Seoul’s fortress wall. JW Marriott Dongdaemun Square Seoul is a modern  luxury hotel that opened in 2013 with 170 rooms and 15 suites across 11 floors. This revolving  door rotates very slowly, but it gives you time to take notice of JW’s griffin logo. There are  normal doors next to this, if you want to enter and exit the hotel more quickly. This is the  lobby, which is incredibly well-lit thanks to the floor to ceiling glass windows. On the left  are two sets of elevators and a griffin statue. This is the front desk area. Notice the marble  reception desks and floors, very opulent. Adjacent to the front desk area is  The Lounge which offers afternoon tea service and dinner and drinks in the  evening, with a great view of Heunginjimun. This is a 1 King Bed, Skyview Room. A really  cool feature in this hotel is that your room key activates your room. This is double-edged  as it makes it easier to leave your key in your room and lock yourself out. Along the hallway are  some closets. Here are the robes. This top drawer has a safe, the other drawers are for storage.  Here is the living room and bedroom. It is a bit tight but there is a lot to unpack here.  There is a water boiler, Nespresso machine, and water bottles. This drawer contains tea and  Nespresso pods. The lower drawer has drinkware. This mini fridge has a minibar and space to chill  your drinks - very useful. Most people would miss this, but behind this panel is more drinkware  and another minibar. Another view of the room, there is a king size bed, two small sofas, a  table, and a TV. This is our view of Dongdaemun. This handy little remote controls the  sheers and blinds in the Skyview room. This feature is the Skyview room’s  upgraded benefit over a base room. The bedside control panel has light controls  and only one USB port, definitely lacking on ports. I think it would’ve been better to  have one traditional outlet than only one USB. Moving over to the bathroom, everything is marble  which is luxurious. This is the bathtub. This is the sink area. Notice the hanging mirror and  that you can see the hallway from the bathroom. This part of the counter lifts up to reveal  toiletries, hair dryer and hair straightener, and a mirror. Nice, Aromatherapy products.  My wife will happily load up on these. There is a TV in the bathroom.  There is a bit of a lag to turn on. It swivels so you can continue watching  your kdrama while in the bathtub. Hi. There is a bidet toilet in the corner,  along with a phone and an emergency call button. This is the shower. It has both an adjustable  shower head and a rainfall shower head. The body wash and shampoo  are made by Aromatherapy. Outside of the sliding door is the  entryway. Before leaving the room, guests with Marriott Platinum status or  higher can choose from a list of drinks and desserts as a welcome amenity - we chose  strawberry ice cream and a half bottle of wine. Entering on the eighth floor, then walking  down some stairs, this is the pool floor. And this is the most glamorous pool you  will likely ever see. Let’s admire the pool and the chandeliers from all angles, shall we?  Yeah… I’m pretty sure no one actually swims in this pool. But if you do, it is heated and there  is always a lifeguard on duty. There are some pool chairs on the side, right next to a marble  fireplace - you know, typical swimming pool decor. Looks like an equally glamorous  jacuzzi with some more lounge chairs. And one more view of the super  fancy swimming pool and chandeliers. On the 10th floor, is the Executive Lounge. Lounge access can be purchased when booking  a standard room but is complimentary when booking suites or for those with Marriott Platinum  status or higher. Over here we have two computers. Around the wall, there are some couches and  lounge chairs. I like the room dividers, they are strategically placed and really  increase the amount of privacy in the lounge. Nice, they have chess sets. This is the food area. Drinks and  coffee are available all day. Dinner and cocktails are served between 5- 7pm.  They serve breakfast and lunch as well. They had an open, self-serve bar which looked like  this and was interesting since you usually see a bartender but this version definitely saves money  for the hotel. There is more seating back here. There is an outdoor patio with some more  seating and a great view of Dongdaemun. This door leads right back to  the food and self-serve bar area. This is Tavolo 24, the hotel’s buffet.  Pricing varies by meal. Complimentary breakfast for two is a benefit for those  with Marriott Platinum status or higher. At the entrance are pancakes and a salad  bar. Coffee machines are along the wall. Here are chilled juices and ice  cream. More juices in the fridge. In the center, there are wines  from different countries for sale. Over here we have smoked salmon, behind which is a counter for samgyupsal  and lettuce. On the island are pastries. On the back counter, there are hash  browns, potatoes, sausage, and bacon. This is an omelet station. There are  cereals. This island has oatmeal. More seating and the view. This station in the  back of the buffet has Korean and Japanese food, at least during breakfast. There were two types  of kimchi, edamame, tofu salad, and natto. Around the corner, more kimchi,  braised fish, and takoyaki. On other mornings, this station had sashimi,  just not on the day I film. And some veggies. On the same floor and across the  elevators, there is BLT Steak, the hotel’s steakhouse restaurant which is open  for lunch and dinner. On the 11th and top floor, is The Griffin, the hotel’s rooftop bar which  offers unobstructed views of Dongdaemun. On the lower level is Seoul Baking Company.  There are chilled drinks and fruit in the fridge. They sell desserts, wine,  sandwiches, and pastries. Exiting this door leads directly to the  subway which is incredibly convenient for getting around Seoul. Oh, as one last  reminder of how luxurious this hotel is, this is the men’s public  bathroom on the lower level. Rating time. I give the skyview room 4 out of 5  for its functionality, marble bathroom, the cool hidden compartments, and of course, the skyview  windows. The main drawbacks were the lack of outlets and space. I think the baseroom, without  the skyview windows, would be a 3 out of 5 though. For the amenities, I have to give  a 3 out of 5. Even though the pool, the rooftop bar, the executive lounge, and  the restaurants were of very high quality, this hotel was missing some common amenities such  as a gym and spa. When I asked about the gym, spa, and golf simulator amenities listed on the  hotel’s website, multiple staff told me that access was prohibited which seemed odd.  After the trip, there was a note on the website saying these facilities may be closed  due to government restriction, but staff never mentioned those restrictions during our stay.  Whatever the case, with the addition of a gym, spa, and golf simulator, the amenities  rating would easily be a 4, maybe even a 5. For intangibles, JW Marriott easily scores a  5 out of 5. Their location is convenient and their service is excellent. Within a block of  the property, is a lot of shopping, dining, and Dongdaemun Design Plaza. Walking out of the lower  level leads directly to the subway which is super convenient. The staff were helpful, they helped  us hail taxis and secured a dinner reservation at Viking’s Wharf, a coveted seafood buffet, and at  an art gallery. The staff were fluent in English which was helpful and makes sense given their  international clientele. We noticed the maids left us water bottles and two chocolates every  day during room cleaning. Much appreciated. For cash value, when we booked in September 2022,  room rates for the skyview room were about $400 per night. At that price, I would have to give  a 2 out of 5 - little value given the lack of amenities, you’d essentially be paying for the  room and the pool. If the gym, spa, and golf simulator were available, then maybe a 3 out of 5.  Or if you are Marriott Platinum or higher, a 3 out of 5 since you would have complimentary access to  the Executive Lounge and Tavolo 24 for breakfast. For points value, award nights were going  for about 47,000 Marriott points per night at which I would give a 4 out of 5. This  is a good redemption. I would recommend booking with points, and remember  Marriott gives the 5th night free when you book 5 consecutive award nights  - even better value, this is what we did. In summary, JW Marriott Dongdaemun Square  Seoul is a modern luxury hotel with high quality amenities. I recommend booking  with points. The value proposition isn’t as strong when booking with cash unless you  have Marriott Platinum status or higher, or until all of the amenities  are available. That is all for my review of the JW Marriott Dongdaemun  Square Seoul. Thanks for joining."}
{"video_id":"-EZ6Eeda_wg","lang":"en","full_text":"okay Josh Here and Now I want to do a quick comparison between the Saint Regis which we just stayed at for two nights here in Mexico City which is that building right behind me there and the Ritz Carlton which we are at now here in Mexico City these are actually the two most expensive hotels in all of Mexico City ranging from anywhere from 700 to over thousands of dollars per night depending on the time of year that you\u0027re choosing to visit now if you\u0027re a Marriott bonboy member there you can use your well-earned points to stay at either one and the rates fluctuate so here\u0027s the website looking at the Saint Regis Mexico City and the Ritz Carlton Mexico City first up I\u0027m going to show you the points values for the Saint Regis as you can see it ranges from about 53 000 points some nights way over 70 000 uh per night for the Ritz Carlton uh it\u0027s about around the same between like 60 and 70 000 points per night which is a really really good value uh compared to the cash rate now here\u0027s the cash rate at the Saint Regis Mexico City I\u0027m just gonna go January through June just the beginning of each month just to show you the prices but as you can see the lowest you really see is about 4.99 that\u0027s before tax so even with tax everything is at least about six seven hundred dollars per night same thing goes here with the Ritz Carlton it is just a little bit more expensive but it\u0027s still very very uh High there 600 to 700 per night making the points a really good value because you\u0027re getting over a penny a point which is tremendous now the Saint Regis I will be honest we did feel like they had a little bit better service uh because they do have the Butlers which can bring you tea upon requesting coffee and things like that um the Ritz Carlton didn\u0027t have that um the Saint Regis also is a more of a um traditional field Hotel it\u0027s not as new and modern as but it\u0027s Carlton but it\u0027s still very elegant and very well appointed very very nice we also enjoyed the breakfast a little bit better at the Saint Regis it\u0027s an all-you-can buffet and if you\u0027re an Elite member with Maria Putnam and hire it you do get two complimentary free breakfasts at the St Regis now the Ritz Carlton I will be honest is the hotel that I would personally choose to come back to and that is because the room the bathroom the whole facility the building is all brand new modern clean and the views there\u0027s nothing like it it blows almost every other Hotel I\u0027ve ever stayed at out of the water now it does come with a little less uh when it comes like to benefits for elite members there\u0027s no free breakfast there\u0027s nothing really free with your stay except you do get access to the pool and fitness center and things like that overall if you care more about classic luxury uh something more unique and had established hotel that\u0027s been here for a very long time and you also care about getting that complimentary breakfast if you\u0027re platinum and higher with Marriott and you really want the best service definitely recommend staying at the St Regis which is that round building there behind me if you care all about a modern luxury something brand new something that will blow your mind how the architecture works and you do still care about really great service I recommend the Ritz Carlton you will not be disappointed the rooms here at the Ritz Carlton are incredible new modern the rooms of this ingredients are also nice they\u0027re just more of a classic luxury something the hotel has been here for about a little over 13 years so it\u0027s been here a while Fritz Carlton is brand new but one of the best in the world here at the Ritz so if you\u0027re coming either hotel is going to be a great option you can\u0027t go wrong with either one of the best of the best of Mexico City but those just kind of the comparisons from thank you so much for watching the links are below of my review for both the Ritz Carlton and St Regis individually also please subscribe as you won\u0027t want to miss my next review as it has a chance to be a perfect score thank you so much"}

Chef VIXX\u0027s side is a scarf. 5 Let\u0027s find out more. [Music] [Applause] Uh uh uh. There is no such thing as a new business called Seri located in Myeongdong, Seoul. My friend applied right now. There is something called a hotel with a chin and strength. Now, the base pro is coming. Ah, if you pour a check on the day, won. Ah, the appearance is big. C is improved. Then, now, go up to the guest room and move. Just gel is a smart hotel where a robot performs front desk work. It is said that the world\u0027s first robot hotel was registered in the Guinness Book of World Records. It opened in Myeongdong, Seoul in August 2021 as the first hell branch. Fan too many times. It means that it keeps changing, and it is essential to respond sensitively to trends and continuously change in order to specifically meet the needs of customers. The stylish and simple interior of the hotel is inspired by a spaceship. Robe 50 is a style that moves around the hotel and actively purchases cutting-edge technology.  It reminds me of a living space in the near future. The room I stayed in was a high-rise kiln room. For the free snow and 50 extra, you get the option to choose a room on the 5th floor with a view of the south. I think it would be good to keep this in mind when making a reservation. The so-called \"guy\" is a minimalistic and cost-effective room that is good for two people. It was compactly configured with a twin bed, a small side table, and a mini bar. The hotel is basically an unmanned hotel. So, even the ice service is all done by robots. There\u0027s a person holding a cooler next to the bed like this. I\u0027ll drink all the water I\u0027m soaking in and ask for water through the person holding the 4th machine. Jin, please bring me some water. 5. I can\u0027t find the way. They said they can\u0027t find the fire. [Music] 5. I pressed the \"to\" button, and the front desk staff must be Bonnie Lang. They said up to two bottles of water per room are free, so they\u0027re going to bring it to me through the robot now. Then I\u0027ll wait. Pang Gyeong-do knocked on the button. Oh, did you see it? Ah, 5. Yucheon-ah, 10. The goods have arrived. In the people\u0027s story corner, who opened the tab? Water and toll.  I\u0027ll practice until I\u0027m submerged in the North Pole. Please press the button to receive it. Our gum-drenched meadow bird 5 uh uh uh uh [music] w\u0026w You guys are now going to Myeongdong, Seoul with me and having a good robot Itaewon fan body together. Oh, my first impression of the room was that it was very clean, but I felt that it was organized in a central configuration. 5 The area here doesn\u0027t seem that difficult, but since it was a company, the floor mat and the rabbit were also placed next to it. Here is a mini bar. Mr. Woo, the lecture is also well-colored. Car English entrance cursor. Reality detection. Initial Lang 6 trillion. That\u0027s a new large space. It became a speed that was good for a moment. If you look, I\u0027ll give you 5%. This is where you get the sleeping model. Code like this. 50 people go this way. There\u0027s a sink. And inside it like this. All the way, # There\u0027s a break. But this is what that guy is there now. It gives more separation. If these three spaces are highly separated, go find them with 3 using c. Short fights are kind. If you look at it that way, the world is better than happiness.  Gum octopus room q ya but still 3 4 5 next down male pa 5 female constant and real hole in the lid with Korean movie 8 deco spring because it\u0027s spring and I think it\u0027s a merit that I can stay in such a clean and well-organized room at this price. Then I wrote it down and furniture art 9 but if there\u0027s one thing I regret, it\u0027s that I cook a lot of rice because I want to do this, but yes, I thought it would be more comfortable to work without paying infinitely in the shade of the business all work space always dropped cable slaughtered funds paper and chairs and tables. But then, if you come play with wealth and come nearby glory or deng kamm what if you need a place to sleep, I\u0027m this too much. It\u0027s a temper like this. 5 can be received. In fact, right now krw sexy is specific, too. 5 people together, watching together, Urang clinical talk, this kind of look. In the drama, a little [music] uh suddenly the screen became dark. In order to show you all the beautiful night view, we decided to split the room pool somewhat. Then, let\u0027s open the inner curtains and watch the effect together. Special offer Namsan  The tower lights up are so beautiful. It\u0027s humid and nice, even down to Dororong. It\u0027s really a male- friendly place. I was explaining the room type right here. Then, I\u0027ll finish the next Namsan Tower and come back tomorrow. Just go to sleep. [Music] This time, we\u0027ll take a look at the auxiliary facilities. The hotel is a compact concept, so the auxiliary facilities aren\u0027t very diverse, so I\u0027ll briefly introduce them. The restaurant is right there when you enter the hotel and turn right. It\u0027s currently operating as a breakfast restaurant, but the breakfast room will be served as a boxed lunch until further notice due to the plaster. There is a coin-operated laundry room, ice machine, and smoking room on the first basement floor. There is a detergent bounce vending machine and two large washing machines and a dryer at the coin-operated laundry room. It seems useful for long-term guests. There is an ice maker in the laundry room. Feel free to use it when you need ice. The smoking room is located next to the laundry room. I\u0027m worried that the cigarette smoke and smell might rise in the basement, but ventilation and deodorization are done.  I guess I won\u0027t do it thoroughly. Good morning everyone. Right now, the blackout curtains are drawn, so it\u0027s dark, but I used it once and each one is like this [music] Light is coming in. Ugh, it\u0027s a key difference. If you come today, it\u0027s a beautiful view of Namsan. On Kun\u0027s religiousness is 107, but still, my aunt is right. Namsan and I are here. What is it? Now, a man will release a fortune. [music] I brought English to the trench. Let\u0027s go in. [music] I\u0027m more prepared because it\u0027s work and the city. I\u0027ll use it twice. I\u0027m thinking about it now. The herbivore came out. Ah, I ordered a stay with my eyes, but Song Maki, full of Mars, said I was full, so I had chicken salad and Kim. It was really tight. 1,900 won. I rested and had a quick meal. And I sold it to America. I ate breakfast and went back to buy the luggage I brought. The longer it went up, the more I came. 4 It looked delicious to me, but of course, the actual visuals were the same. I packed a lunch box and thought, \"The rich think 5 It seems a little too flashy for my taste. So it\u0027s not that it\u0027s tasteless. Just uh, the album, the island, and a simple, angry retirement.  Let\u0027s try a major that you can cut. Ah, in the old days, even if you went to the rice fields, you couldn\u0027t do it. Please like and subscribe to me. Bye."}
{"video_id":"-Cc3f2gJKZI","lang":"en","full_text":"Hello, Kim Won-seong is here. It\u0027s morning now. My voice is a little hoarse, but this is the St. John\u0027s Hotel. Yes, it\u0027s the St. John\u0027s Hotel. I slept in a regular room on purpose. That\u0027s because many people leave various types of comments on my YouTube channel, and the ones I pay the most attention to are hotel-related ones. I especially pay attention to those who have stayed at the hotel and talked about things they felt, whether they need improvement or are dissatisfied with. I take notes on everything. I can\u0027t list 100 things at once, but the staff can talk about what they saw firsthand. The best thing is for me to be a consumer. That\u0027s why I intentionally stay at different hotels even when I go on business trips to Seoul. There\u0027s a huge difference between going on a quick field trip and actually staying for a day as a pitcher. You can see it because when I go on a field trip, I only check the things I need to check in a short period of time and come back, so I end up missing a lot of things. But when I use it for a full day, one night, I can.  If it\u0027s done, there\u0027s a lot more to see from the user\u0027s perspective. So for the same reason, I deliberately stayed at the hotel yesterday and slept. As expected, I saw a lot of things while sleeping and felt that it needed to be improved. One of the most frequently commented topics was the bathroom floor being slippery and dangerous, and that children could get hurt. I\u0027ve been monitoring this, and in fact, we\u0027ve already started applying non-slip material. I did n\u0027t tell you guys, but we\u0027ve already started. The room I stayed in today is a room that has already been applied. However, the moisture permeability rate is very high. It\u0027s almost 90% on average. It\u0027s summer, so it\u0027s a bit longer. The construction speed is because it takes at least one or two nights to set up blocks, but we can\u0027t do that right now. But anyway, we\u0027re doing it, and we\u0027ll finish applying the anti-slip material within the year. I\u0027ll film the video separately and show you. And the second one, but there were a lot of comments about the wallpaper being damaged or something. So, as soon as I checked in, I looked closely at the wallpaper. But of course, There are some areas where the wallpaper has come off. Since we\u0027re right by the sea, it\u0027s coming off due to the salt in the air, humidity, and seasonal temperature differences. That might be a bit harsh, and if we had just painted it, it wouldn\u0027t have happened, but anyway, since it\u0027s a sheet, we\u0027re actually replacing it. As I mentioned, it\u0027s a bit slow. To replace it, we have to tear it off, re-apply it, and let it cure. This takes a few days. So, since we\u0027re looking for rooms like this among the clean rooms, it\u0027s taking some time, so I hope you\u0027ll be patient. The important thing is that we\u0027re replacing it. Since our hotel is now over six years old, there are many worn-out parts here and there that need to be replaced or repaired. So, we\u0027ve prepared for those things in advance. However, since guests only evaluate a hotel based on what they see, I fully understand that, and I \u0027ll do my best to not delay and get things done. And recently, I explained the purpose of the reusable slippers, and I\u0027ve received many comments saying, \"The purpose is great. Thank you for your sympathy. It\u0027s all great.\"  I\u0027ve seen many comments saying that they don\u0027t understand the purpose of the hotel and wish they would explain the purpose of the hotel somewhere. So, I think this is too much of an operator\u0027s behavior, so I suggested yesterday that we put up separate signage where the slippers are placed. Once the signage arrives in a few days, we\u0027ll place it in a prominent location. So, the slippers are a product we developed and manufactured ourselves to reduce the massive amount of disposable waste that\u0027s thrown away. We always wash and disinfect them, so you can use them with confidence. I\u0027ll put a separate sign somewhere. Finally, this is the room I stayed in, an ocean view room. It\u0027s an ocean view room with a panoramic view of the ocean. You can see the pool below, and if you tilt your head, you can see the lake tower slightly. Why did I show you this? My room is located in the center of the ocean tower. It has a very good ocean view in front of it, and if you go out to the balcony and look to the left, you can see the lake tower. A few days ago, a YouTuber who reviews the hotel pointed this out. When I entered the room, there was a view below.  The pool is visible, and the lake tower to the side blocks the view of the ocean in front. Can this be sold as an ocean view? I was a bit skeptical that this wasn\u0027t an ocean view just because there was a building on the left, although the ocean was clearly visible. But then I thought about it again. Don\u0027t think from the operator\u0027s perspective. For example, if I paid 300,000 won and was assigned to Seaside and came in, I could see the pool below, and the building next to it made me feel bad. Or, if it wasn\u0027t what I had imagined, I could feel bad. So, the room in question was actually room 1141. I went up there, opened the door, and when I looked inside, all I could see was the ocean. But as you enter the room, you can see the lake tower to the left, and now you can see the pool under the balcony. Just like the person said, if you come here for the first time with a blank slate, you can see it if you really want to. That\u0027s right. Of course, the ocean is clear and visible, but if you\u0027re sensitive or if you came expecting to see nothing but the ocean, you might be disappointed. I thought about that too.  And so, we decided to completely change the room types that were causing that impact. I already talked about it yesterday. Changing the room types themselves is something managers really hate. Now, people in the hotel industry will probably completely agree. It\u0027s because it requires a lot of work to change the types. But anyway, this is also a manager\u0027s responsibility. Whenever I talk to my employees, I always say, no matter what we do, we make all decisions from the consumer\u0027s perspective, and the managerial work that follows is just our responsibility. The moment we think from the manager\u0027s perspective, things go wrong. So, even I, as a consumer, looked into this again. So, I\u0027m actually grateful to that person. Thanks to that person, I was able to prevent any misunderstandings from guests who might be disappointed. So, I\u0027d like to implement this right away, but we\u0027re almost fully booked until August, so we can\u0027t change the types now. Now, at the end of summer, we\u0027ll prepare in advance and completely change the room types. For example, what I\u0027m thinking right now is, if I were to name the Lake Tower Pool Ocean View, it literally encapsulates all the meaning of the type itself. Lake Tower, too.  You can see the swimming pool, you can see the ocean. I gave you an example. Anyway, to avoid any misunderstandings, I will change the type name and apply it as soon as possible, around fall. I think this is the pre-function of YouTube. Of course, I run a hotel, but I work really hard as a YouTuber. But this has its pros and cons. Doing YouTube while doing this business has its fatal cons, because I know very well that every single one of my actions can have a negative impact on the company\u0027s image. But on the other hand, if I didn\u0027t do YouTube, there are many advantages that I would never know, feel, and be able to take action on. That\u0027s what I talked about in today\u0027s video. In the future, I will not ignore any helpful comments from our subscribers or viewers, but will reflect them in our operations. Although it is lacking, I will do my best to make the hotel a better place where consumers can truly come and be satisfied. Everyone."}

{"video_id":"dSM-tIZmI9w","lang":"en-CA","full_text":"Hello everyone, I’m heading to Seoul, South Korea, which is my home city, and I am going to stay at the Lotte Hotel Seoul. So, I will share my room tour video with you today. Let’s get started. There are two different buildings in Lotte Hotel Seoul one is the Main Tower, and the other one is the Executive Tower, which is higher-end and pricier. I am going to stay in the Executive Tower. There are some liquors as well as coffee and tea. The tea is from Osulloc, a premium tea brand from Jeju Island, Korea. There are also some wine glasses, coffee cups, and wine. In the drawer, there are some snacks, toothbrushes, and toothpaste available for an extra charge. In the small refrigerator, there are some sodas, water, and champagne. They provide two bottles of water every day during your stay. Beside the bed, there are lighting control buttons, a USB port, and a power outlet. The closet seems a bit smaller than I expected I found it wasn’t enough to store all my clothing. Also, there is a small safe right here. The bathroom was clean. You can open the blind to see into the room or close it for privacy. Robes and slippers were provided as well. The living room wasn’t that big considering the price range, but the Seoul city view was amazing. One thing I found inconvenient is that you pay extra for staying in the Executive Tower, but all other amenities are in the Main Tower. Therefore, you had to walk all the way to the Main Tower to enjoy the other facilities. There is a gym, golf driving range, and swimming pool. The main reason I stayed in this hotel is because of the location. It is very close to the subway station. Also, right beside the hotel, there is the Lotte Department Store, where you can enjoy tax-free shopping. You can also walk to Myeongdong Street, a famous shopping and eating street in Seoul, and it is very close to the palace, where you can explore traditional Korean culture. I am going to leave the website link in the description box below. I hope my video is helpful. Thanks so much for watching, and I will see you in my next video. Bye!"}
{"video_id":"bjPcYOHN90Q","lang":"en","full_text":"The first private hotel in Korea has returned after two years of remodeling. If you are a Kang Su mania, you will be impressed by the Ambassador Seoul Pullman, which is receiving a 4 star rating. Let\u0027s find out together whether the remaining pitchers were satisfied. [Music] Hello, I am a man who is leaving again. In 1955, not long after the end of the Korean War, the first private 5-star hotel in Korea, Geum Su-jang, opened on a hill in Jangchung-dong. There are many hotels with a long history, but Geum Su-jang is significant in that it was established and operated 100% with private capital without any intervention from the government or institutions from the beginning to the present. In 1965, Geum Su-jang changed its name to Ambassador, the name of the hotel where he would be sent off. It is said that it meant that it would serve as a private ambassador to promote Korea. Starting with 19 rooms on two floors, Geum Su- jang expanded three times and became a large hotel with 409 rooms. In 1987, it formed a strategic partnership with Pang Su Arc Hotel and became part of the Accor brand.  We will advance into Korea together. Come, do you know? There is a reason why the name Ambassador is always included when we open a hotel. This hotel was also operated under the brand Sofitel in 2007, and then changed to the Pullman brand in 2009, and continues to this day. Meanwhile, a fire broke out in January 2020. After that, due to the coronavirus, the hotel began remodeling and is scheduled to reopen after construction is completed at the end of January 2022. In other words, the exterior of the building has changed a lot. It is noteworthy that the dark tone of the existing exterior has been maintained, but the view from the guest rooms has been expanded through the construction of the front cartner. When you pass through the entrance, the hotel lobby, which does not have many guests, has a completely different appearance from the past. What catches the eye the most is the media art of artist Lee In-nam, which depicts Geumgangsan Mountain. Based on the painting of Geumdang Naesan by Gyeomjae Jeong Seon, it shows the four seasons of Gangsan Mountain on a large display for 10 minutes and 8 seconds. As the first private hotel in Korea, it is a place that showcases the beauty of Korea.  I was impressed by how modern technology was used to showcase the hotel\u0027s modern design. The lobby isn\u0027t very tall, but the high ceiling in front of the entrance enhances security. To the left is the front desk, where check-in takes place. The front desk is simple and clean, and thanks to the wood-toned wall behind it, it blends well with the modern Korean atmosphere of the lobby. My complaint is that, while the number of guest rooms has been drastically reduced during the reopening, a total of 10 different types of rooms have been prepared. However, only the fishing boat type is currently open for the initial opening, and the rest will be sequentially added to the 5-room plan. The room I\u0027m staying in is an executive room, which is a room with the added benefit of using the executive room A posted in the Deluxe Room. The room\u0027s overall beige tone gives it a warm and welcoming feel. At 28 square meters, it\u0027s a bit smaller than rooms in similar hotels, so I was worried. However, thanks to the enlarged full-length windows and glass bathroom walls after the remodel, it feels a bit smaller, but it does n\u0027t feel stuffy. Although it\u0027s a similar beige color, the tone-on-tone design creates a sense of distinction, preventing it from being monotonous. The pink lighting, which creates a warm, warm feeling, brightens the room overall. The floor is mostly made of papier-mâché or wood, mainly around the edges. The rooms are long, but the view of Namsan Mountain through the window is impressive. The hotel is located on a high hill and is close to Namsan Mountain, so it feels like you can really touch Namsan Tower. In front, you can see the Dongguk University campus and a low residential area. As a view enthusiast, I really liked the large windows and the view of Namsan Tower. However, due to the nature of the full-length windows, the interior gets very hot when exposed to direct sunlight, so it is twice as hot in the winter. The hotel also has a view of Namsan Mountain from the east, and it has a view of Boshim. It is a view from Jangchung Gymnasium to Doosan Tower in Dongdaemun, and it is not just the earth that is unique. I definitely recommend the Namsan branch for the rooms. There is a long sofa and a small table with a cafe view, but the twin room has a table and two chairs instead of a long sofa. The bed mattress is a Simmons Beautyrest product, and there is a TV and work cables opposite the bed. The birdsong and the winding-like sound coming from the TV are impressive. This time, outside the hotel.  It seems to have been inspired by the idea that hard work embodies the world. The lobby lounge\u0027s afternoon tea is also served in the shape of the world. The bathroom next to the guest room entrance is quite compact due to the inevitable size of the room. To maximize space, the toilet is placed next to the sink without a separate space. However, the fact that even a bathtub was installed shows that efforts were made. The bathtub is integrated into the shower booth. The amenities are Penhaligon\u0027s Coke products from the British perfume brand, and they are provided in a perfume bottle. I personally really like the scent. It would have been nice, but unfortunately, the hairdryer doesn\u0027t seem to have been replaced. Bathroom amenities are simple, with a toothbrush and a minimal amount of products provided. A midi-file espresso capsule coffee machine comes with five capsules. My favorite is Ronnefeldt Tea Bell\u0027s, and two tea bags are also provided. A wide variety of options are also available, and guests staying in the executive rooms can use all air conditioning units, except for alcohol, free of charge. The rooms were generally decent and pretty, and the view was also fantastic.  It was good. Since the reopening of the hotel, the attention has been focused on the Club NB on the 18th floor. The lounge, which is available to guests staying in the Executive Room and the upper-level Suite Rooms, has a great view. It feels like a mix of the simple yet sophisticated feel of the Shilla Hotel Executive Lounge and the bright and flashy feel of the Lotte Hotel Seoul salon. The fact that it feels like the first of two good places means that it is good. Afternoon tea, happy hour, and even Josie are provided. Let \u0027s see how well it is served. Afternoon tea was initially served on a two-tiered tray, but these days it is served raw. There are six types of desserts on one plate, including scones and sandwiches on another plate. The desserts were not bad, but I wonder if this is the product. Of course, this is also a frozen dessert imported from Pensée, but if it is the same product, it might be a little disappointing. In any case, when eating dessert at a hotel, you expect it to be made by the hotel\u0027s party chef or bakery, not a specialty. In addition, three types of cookies are prepared, and simple drinks and tea are provided. In fact, the level of lounge food is determined during happy hour. When I first encountered the food, I felt that I understood why Fullman was so well- received. There was a huge variety of food, and there were many choices, including Shine Musk and Key, and they put a lot of thought into the menu. Not only that, they also prepared a sensible menu. It was surprising that they even had a live station in a lounge. Personally, I enjoyed the grilled mero and the lemon-colored mussel gratin. The wine and spirits seemed a bit weak, but they provided cocktail recipes so you can try them and make them yourself. The Zephyr Hour, where the ambassador came out, was top-notch. The Shilla Hotel Executive Lounge is comparable to the Belle Salon in terms of quality. Of course, if you compare the quality of each dish, I would give the Shilla Hotel a hand, but when you look at the level of the food, it definitely has shortcomings compared to Shilla 5-Pa. I would recommend it to those who enjoy tapas and coffee or those who enjoy working out at a restaurant. The food was also good.  It feels a bit more relaxed than right after opening. Originally, 5 Field 1 was initially intense and then gradually changed. I hope it will remain at its current level without much change. The stock was provided by The Kings, a traditional restaurant that has been in operation since 1977. The restaurant itself wasn\u0027t particularly large, but it\u0027s about half the size of the Shilla Hotel Parkview. While there aren\u0027t any memorable signature menus, the food is well- prepared and varied. While the in- flight domain food in the morning was a bit lacking, overall, the composition and taste were neither lacking nor special. It was an average, moderately priced restaurant befitting a 5-star hotel. I ate leisurely, but the Big Bag is a bit small for the number of rooms, so I think it\u0027s quite crowded on weekends. The Kings has a deep and high worldview, and it seems to be putting a lot of effort into each field. The reopening dinner was held at a famous Chinese restaurant where the chef was located, and the promotion was changed to Ho Bin, led by the famous chef who created the reputation of the current Shilla Hu Tefal line.  The hotel has been offering Chef Stable, European Fine Dining, World Lobby Lounge, and Lounge Bar. The entire hotel is not open yet, so when I visited, only Ho Bing and the Lounge Bar in the lobby on the first floor were open. The hotel\u0027s auxiliary facilities, the Wellness Center, located on the basement level, include a swimming pool and fitness center. While the pool is located in the basement and has no view, they\u0027ve tried to add a touch of sensibility by installing ceiling lights. Many recently opened hotels have a basement but still offer a stunning sensibility. Compared to those, this one looks shabby and lacks functionality. The pool is also too small in terms of functionality. For those who enjoy swimming, it\u0027s only a few feet away, so it\u0027s a bit small. It \u0027s a good thing that there are two fairly large Jacuzzis installed on the upper level. The Ttin Lee pool isn\u0027t very large, but it\u0027s well-equipped. There\u0027s no view or sensibility, but it \u0027s a good place if you\u0027re looking to exercise. One of the most ambitious things Pullman prepared while refining was the outdoor pool, but unfortunately, it\u0027s not open yet.  It\u0027s not open yet. The outdoor pool is now free only for those staying in the tube and suite rooms, and even if you\u0027re staying on the points scale, you have to pay an entrance fee. They say there will be poolside suites right next to the pool, so I\u0027m looking forward to it. So, what\u0027s your overall review of the Ambassador Seoul Pullman? I welcome this new, well-balanced 5-star hotel in Gangbuk. However, there are some issues to be resolved. There are many 5-star hotels in Korea, but compared to the Gangnam Geonho style, many of them have poor guest rooms and facilities, so it\u0027s not easy to find a hotel with a modern feel. In that respect, it has a large lobby, a nice view, and a decent view. It\u0027s okay now, and the facilities are a bit disappointing, but I wo n\u0027t be disappointed once the outdoor pool opens, so I think it\u0027s a well-balanced hotel with no major flaws. However, the problem is the price. When comparing the 7, excluding use of the club lounge, it \u0027s about 30,000 to 50,000 won cheaper than the Killer. I wonder if people will go to the Pullman instead of the Shilla Hotel just because it\u0027s 50,000 won cheaper. Whether it\u0027s the lounge or the rooms, it\u0027s all in one place.  If you think about it, the Shilla Hotel isn\u0027t far behind in many aspects, and the overall luxurious service level of the hotel exudes an Ao Da atmosphere. Considering this, the question is whether that price difference will make people choose the Pullman over the Shilla Hotel. The two hotels are located in the same Dongdaemun Station, close enough to be seen from each other. Therefore, if you were to evaluate the hotel\u0027s competitiveness based on cost-effectiveness, it would n\u0027t be a good score. I think they need to adjust their admission policy to be more competitive in order to attract guests who truly love the pool, rather than those who are curious enough to visit once or twice. Anyway, I have a pretty good guess, and I\u0027m really looking forward to the CT and outdoor pool when it opens. I\u0027ll visit again once it\u0027s fully open. If you like traveling and resting, please check out my channel. It\u0027s a little embarrassing, but you know it\u0027s really helpful. Please subscribe, like, and turn on notifications. The next video will be a review of Banyan Tree Seoul, a luxury hotel with a large in-room spa. Then, I\u0027ve finally gotten to the point where I\u0027m a man who\u0027s left again. Thank you.

{"video_id":"mQTeEq9qPW0","lang":"en","full_text":"Among the three major domestic motel brands in Korea, Shilla, Joseon, and Lotte Hotel have their own 5-star luxury brands. On the other hand, the Chosun Hotel, which did not have a top-class hotel brand until now, finally has one. The cheapest room is 400,000 won, and the most expensive b in Korea is 90,000 won. Let\u0027s find out together with today\u0027s departure [music] Hello, I\u0027m a man again. I\u0027m a man again. Joseon fan wrote about the history of Gangnam, Seoul. The wall and performance history 2. The newly constructed twin building is located in the center field of the West Power. There must be some of you who have been there. The Ssangsu Hotel was originally there for nearly 30 years, but it was torn down and rebuilt and newly opened as the center field in 2021. The Chosun Penis opened in the heart of Gangnam, Seoul. Let\u0027s forget about the Chosun Audrey. It\u0027s the first top-class hotel brand to be introduced, so we really made a lot of efforts to supply it. It\u0027s the top brand of Manhunt, the Luxury Collection, and you can also receive member benefits. Hotel Leaf or CR  There are floors. Uniformed staff personally open the shiny door and the welcome lobby appears right away. Check-in is not done in the welcome lobby, but only to leave your luggage and confirm your contract. Daniel Asha\u0027s sculpture Moses, a symbol of a new era, stands out. In addition to the welcome lobby, around 400 works by famous domestic and international artists are exhibited throughout the hotel under the concept of the golden age of modern Korea. Check-in is done at the Grand Reception on the 25th floor. In fact, it is a lounge and a mob. The Grand Reception has a unique bright and luxurious feel with red sofas and gold crepe. The circular pattern that unifies the ceiling and floor is also impressive. The view of southern Seoul from the 25th floor is also cool. There is a check-in counter and concierge, and regardless of the room class, you can easily sit down and check in. Chosun Paris has a total of nine types of rooms. Broadly speaking, there are four types of standard rooms, three types of suites, and two types of the best suites. The Stater Master\u0027s rooms can be considered the most basic rooms, while the Brand Masters and Grand Master Spain are considered premium basic rooms. From the swing, there is a living room and a  The bedrooms are separate, but please note that the Master Suite is also a Curio 0 for the Swe team. There is also a 411-square-meter luxury Chosun Grand Master Suite on the 35th floor. I have stayed at Chosun Palace twice, and the most basic one is the master\u0027s room in one of the hotel\u0027s few corner rooms, the Grand Master Scale. Room 34275 is located at the end of the hallway. To get to the bedroom, you have to walk all the way to the end of the hallway. Since it is a corner room, the entire hallway has a great city view. It is close to the Gangnam Finance Center and Kyobo Tower, and the Han River. It is a city that reminds me of New York. If you walk to the end of the hallway with the great view behind you, you will find the room. The bedroom uses various colors and textures at the same time. The warm beige carpet decorates the floor in a fun way, as if putting together puzzle pieces. There is an interesting texture and curved feeling on the wall behind the bed, a marble-like recovery, unique lighting, and of course, a footrest at the foot of the bed, a turquoise sofa opposite, and even a fabric sofa.  It really shows off its strong individuality. It\u0027s surprising how many colors and textures were used, but instead of feeling cluttered and crowded, it feels sophisticated and luxurious. Behind the purple sofa, you can see the western Terran lobby that we saw from the hallway. Behind the green sofa opposite the bed, you can see the apartment complex and Tower Palace in the south. In addition, since the rooms are arranged in all directions, there are also B in the east and B in the north. From the east, you can see the Note Tower, the Trade Center, and the Han River slightly. From the north, you can see the residential area of ​​Yeoksam-dong and Namsan Tower in the distance. The king-size Sim looks like a test line, and you can sleep comfortably with the best Andrea products from the famous Italian royal family. There is a Bluetooth speaker on the bedside table and a tablet PC can be used to request almost all services, from room control to various music services and amenities. The wireless charging pad installed on the table was also very convenient. Next to the bed is a Samsung Electronics smart TV. The TV is not only large in size but also has excellent picture quality.  It\u0027s clean and feels like watching a movie. The only downside is that the TV is positioned so you have to watch it from the bed. It was just uncomfortable during the sale. There\u0027s a work space in front of the TV, and you can see that a lot of thought went into this as well. Let\u0027s take a look at the bathroom. The bathroom is divided into a bedroom and a guest room, and can be entered from either side. The dark marble and gold faucet go well together. There\u0027s a bathtub on one side, and the shower is also separate, with a chair provided. The toilet is located in the wall next to the entrance, and there\u0027s also a small sink. The culprit is Lee Chang-soo, a brand bar that was neglected. If you do it, you can get wine. It\u0027s even more meaningful because it\u0027s a product you can find at Josun Palace\u0027s amenities, Roma. Various amenities, starting with the size, are provided, and each box shows the Sun Palace logo. It\u0027s surprising that even this kind of attention was paid. The hair dryer is an ultra-lightweight Onda Air Cara. Between the entrance hallway and the greed, there\u0027s a space to put the pillows and Samsung Electronics\u0027 Address. Usually, in other hotels, air conditioners are installed in the upper suites, but all rooms at Josun Palace have 4 Addresses. In addition, all rooms are equipped with Samsung Bespoke Cube Air or Dyson air purifiers.  There is also a shoe rack under the closet. A huge cabinet on one side of the room is a mini bar. Unlike other Chosun hotels, coffee is provided in espresso Overture capsules. Tea is available in a variety of styles, including Seven Smith tea makers and Christine\u0027s own Fortnum \u0026 Mason. The coffee pot is a Line product, and all the 6-day products are made in Germany, Schott Zwiesel porcelain, and even the teaspoons are German. The Grandmaster Spell room is one of only two rooms on the first floor, and its corner location offers a huge benefit of an unobstructed view. This time, we are in one of the cheapest rooms, Master\u0027s Room 3 1207. After passing through the arched entrance along a fairly long hallway, you will find a bedroom with an open space. Except that he is on one side, the room size is similar to the Grandmaster Spell room. The actual size of the two rooms is only about 1.5 pyeong (approximately 3.5 sq ft), which is a large size for a master\u0027s room. There is a small table, but there are two sofas. The space for playing at home and  The difference is that the business is located next to the entrance hallway. The bathroom is pretty, but the door is even prettier. The double-opening translucent door that was impressive at the Grand Josun Busan was the city of Joseon Penis. Usually, rooftop rooms have only one sink, but all rooms at Joseon Palace have two sinks. The shower and toilet are separate, but they are located inside the bathroom. The Master Room, which seems to have nothing to lack except the view, and the Grand Master Spain, which was introduced earlier, are about 200,000 won per night different. You may wonder why it is 10,000 won more expensive just because it is located in the corner. However, the difference in the outside is not simply that there is more. The Joseon Face provides services depending on the room type. So, let\u0027s take a look at the differences in services by room type. There is no club lounge at the Joseon Palace. Instead, there is a food and beverage service provided to guests at set times similar to the club lounge. You can enjoy coffee, tea, and three types of cookies at set times. This service is popular and available to all pitchers regardless of the room type. The food is available at the salon.  You can think of it as similar to 1, but the difference is that if you order using the Chosun Pen, tea and cookies are delivered directly to you. The difference in room service appears from 10 a.m. Breakfast is provided to all Chosun Pension 4 guests, but for guests of the State Masters, a simple basket of bread, juice, and muffins is provided at the Grand Reception on the 25th floor. The student tried it and found it to be insufficient. Moreover, there was no food at all, so it was very disappointing. It would have been better to think there would be no breakfast and sleep in, but since I came down intentionally, there wasn\u0027t enough to eat, it was a shame. Guests of rooms of Grand Masters and above can use the main breakfast buffet for two at Constance. The difference in service between rooms is even greater in the evening service. Wine and canapés are provided to all guests at dinnertime, but guests of Skate and Masters rooms can use the Felice Delight. A canapé set served in a pretty bowl that looks like the world and two glasses of wine per person are provided at the Grand Reception on the E15 side. Set 1 in front of Set 4 is a really simple snack and is a typical hotel lounge.  You should not expect more than the English Masters and Grand Masters Spain Q. The hotel offers two cocktails or a bottle of wine and the world canapé set you saw earlier at the lounge bar, 1914 Chosun, located on the 24th floor. It is unique in that the service is provided at the hotel\u0027s regular food and beverage establishment, 1914 Chosun, rather than a dedicated space. The upper-class suite guests are also provided with the same service at 1914 Chosun, but more expensive cocktails and wine are provided, and whiskey is also available. However, the regular lounge bar has become cramped because so many guests are gathered together, so it is said that from July 9, the brand Masters and Grand Masters Bait Easy service will no longer be provided at 1914 Chosun. It is said that a bottle of wine and a plate will be served in front of the room as room service under the name of Street Illite. In this way, depending on the type of room you stay in, you are divided into three groups: the general room, the upper general class, and the 10m, and breakfast and dinner are provided.  The unique feature of Joseon Palace is that it offers differentiated services. How about the sauna? Breakfast in the regular rooms has recently become unavailable, but fortunately, the pool and fitness center are available to all guests. The pool and fitness center are located on the 26th floor of the Joseon Wellness Club. In fact, one of my favorite things about Joseon Palace was the pool. The ceiling lighting is beautifully decorated, and the Gangnam skyscrapers visible outside are like a folding screen surrounding the testing center. A map of the menu is always provided, and the seniors around the pool are also very appreciative. The pool was beautiful during the day, but after sunset, it was a different experience to be able to enjoy the city night view while accommodating. The ceiling with lights is mirrored, so you can see people relaxing while seeing off guests. Next to the reception area is the fitness center. There was an issue with the 100 million won deposit for a fitness center membership at the Four Seasons 3, 4, and 5 in Gwanghwamun. The leader of the Joseon Palace outdoor pool sold it for 50 million won. It is equipped with the latest equipment and has a separate class room and pt. There are also three benches for internal medicine and plate exercises. It\u0027s a foreign car, and the front raincoat was too much. However, I felt the space was smaller than I thought, perhaps because my expectations were too high for the 150 million won deposit. Personally, I think the Four Seasons is more spacious and well-equipped. Let\u0027s take a look at the hotel\u0027s dining. As I mentioned earlier, except for the Street and Master rooms, all rooms include breakfast at B Pyeongpo Stars on the 24th floor. My expectations for the food were high because of the very high standards and the emotional interior. Since the Chosun Hotel is famous for its delicious food, my expectations were even higher. The basic three types of flour, the malicious comments, and the pancakes, Christo St, were delicious. Even though it was breakfast, I was generously supplied with protein, including salmon, seafood, duck, chicken breast, and pork neck. High-quality Timsum, which used to be served at the Kim Sam Station, was used, and the bakery corner, equipped with a foot media toaster, offers a variety of breads. Breakfast at Constance is delicious. I also wrote this because my expectations for the Chosun Penis were too high.  I\u0027m a little disappointed. I think it would have been better if there were a little more food options. The most recently opened Sweetness is Fairmont, and when comparing it to the Spectrum breakfast at Hotel B Payne Fair Note, I personally give the thumbs up to Fairmont. In addition to Joshi, it is famous for being the most expensive restaurant in Korea, having introduced the first unit price of 250,000 won per person for lunch and dinner buffets. In addition, there is the Chinese restaurant The Crater on the 36th floor and the Korean restaurant Taniki. The Westin Chosun Seoul\u0027s famous Chinese restaurant Hongyeon has been upgraded to the next level, adding \"The Great\" in front of its name. It is a bit pricey at 26,000 won for a bowl of 30,000 won and 89,000 won for six bowls, but fortunately, the taste was really good. If you are thinking of going, I recommend making a reservation in advance and hoping for a window seat with a good view during the Anzu period. Taniki is a Korean restaurant led by Yeonju Lim, former head chef of Fisher Wrestling Star Restaurant in New York, USA. They offer one type of Kushiyoshi for lunch and dinner. There\u0027s also the famous restaurant Chosun Dali at the Chosun Hotel. So, what\u0027s your overall review of Chosun Penis? They really put a lot of thought into it. Above all, the hotel interior is truly luxurious and sophisticated, incomparable to any other hotel in Korea. Of course, I feel like it might look a bit outdated in just five or ten years, but it\u0027s too much or pretentious to evaluate it now with emotions for a future that hasn\u0027t even arrived. At the very least, it\u0027s clear that this is a hotel with the hottest design of this era. In addition, everything that can be traced, from small furniture and electronics in the rooms, even the mini-t and mini-bar, feels like they\u0027re treating everything as top-notch, no matter how small. Furthermore, it\u0027s a hotel located in a high-rise building in the heart of Gangnam, and it has a unique urban luxury that you can\u0027t feel at a Four Seasons or Shilla Stay Season 1. However, there are also downsides. First, the cleanliness is a bit unpleasant. Since even the cheapest room is comparable to a junior suite at most hotels, of course, everyone would want to be treated that way. However, since they provide differentiated service by room type, it\u0027s difficult to find a lower level.  I feel like I\u0027ve gotten to the end of the story. In a typical motel, guests in a suite or regular room don\u0027t even spend 9 minutes in their room. However, at Chosun Penis, whether you\u0027re eating breakfast or drinking wine in the evening, it\u0027s 9 minutes, whether you\u0027re the head or the tail of the dragon. In addition, there\u0027s no such thing as a service that\u0027s provided separately. As I mentioned earlier, guests in the upper-level regular rooms will be served wine and canapés as room service starting in early July. In fact, if you\u0027re going to eat in your room, why not just buy your favorite alcohol or snacks? Why bother with wine that you don\u0027t have a choice of and canapés that you don\u0027t really have to eat? What\u0027s the point of drinking in your room? Would n\u0027t it be more meaningful to create an atmosphere in a nice and emotional lounge? Furthermore, the downside is that all food and beverage services are included in the room rate and cannot be omitted. In particular, some people don\u0027t like simple hamper meals. While hotels usually have rates that include or exclude breakfast, Chosun Penis includes all services, including breakfast, coffee, and even wine throughout the hotel, so the room rate is naturally expensive. The hotel charges extra for additional guests.  They charge 100,000 to 110,000 won per person for the Daehan Shirim service. This means that people who don\u0027t eat breakfast and don\u0027t drink alcohol are being forced to spend 110,000 won unnecessarily. So, the disadvantages accumulate and accumulate, leading to the conclusion that the biggest disadvantage is that it is too expensive. This is my personal recipe #, but since I moved into the center field building with the highest rent in Gangnam, the compensation b, that is, the rent is bound to be high, and of course, the room rate must be raised to make ends meet. However, looking at the competitive 5 status portal for this, I can\u0027t receive much in the industry. So, I think the structure is that the food and beverage service is not an option but a necessity, raising the price and leaving a profit. It\u0027s really great, but the biggest disadvantage is that the price is a bit excessive. If you enjoyed and found today\u0027s video useful, please subscribe and like.
