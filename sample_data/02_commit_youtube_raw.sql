-- sample_data/02_commit_youtube_raw.sql
-- Purpose: Commit staged JSONL rows into final youtube_raw tables (cast/reshape + dedupe), then drop staging tables.
-- Inputs:  <PROJECT_ID>.youtube_stage.{channels_stage,videos_stage,subtitles_segments_stage,subtitles_full_stage}
-- Outputs: <PROJECT_ID>.youtube_raw.{channels,videos,subtitles_segments,subtitles_full}
-- Deps:    Datasets/tables prepared by 01_prepare_youtube_raw.sql; BigQuery permissions to TRUNCATE/INSERT/DROP.
-- Run:     Invoke-BqSqlFile .\sample_data\02_commit_youtube_raw.sql
-- Notes:   Safe to re-run (final tables are truncated). No QUALIFY; use WHERE rn = 1. <PROJECT_ID> is replaced by $env:GCP_PROJECT_ID.
