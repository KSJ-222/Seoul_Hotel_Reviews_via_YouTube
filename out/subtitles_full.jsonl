There are many tourist attractions within 20 minutes of the hotel. The hotel is right in front of the exit of Chungmuro Station on subway lines 3 and 4! And! The airport bus stop is also right in front of the hotel. For more information, please refer to the description below⬇️ or the pinned comment! The hotel lobby is very casual.

The 6701 airport bus stop is located right in front of the hotel. “Glocaloca” hotel occupies the 19th and 20th floors of the Koreana Hotel! It feels like a hotel within a hotel.

Although disposable items will no longer be provided in hotels in Korea starting in April 2024, the \"Glocaloca\" hotel was providing disposable toothbrushes. The facilities were good for the price! It's a great view overlooking the city of Gwanghwamun. The room size is very large for the price in Seoul. The quality of the bed is not that high. It's not luxurious, but I'm satisfied because it's a large room for the price and it's a 4-person room. The area surrounding the hotel is mostly landmarks. I highly recommend the shared kitchen. You can eat cereal, coffee, cocoa, ramen, and more. And the facilities are very clean. You can use the washing machine and detergent for free. Shared office space is also available for free use. Personally, I liked the public services more than the rooms. If you subscribe, we will show you more useful information!

And Cheonggyecheon is located 3 minutes away from the hotel. Myeongdong is about a 10-minute walk away. If you subscribe, we will show you more useful information!

It's convenient because there's a convenience store right next to the reception. Right next to the convenience store is a coin laundry.

The fifth hotel is a residence-style hotel located in Gangnam. It's a little bit away from Seoul Station and Myeongdong. It is close to the Express Bus Terminal Shopping Center, COEX, and Lotte World by public transportation. The hotel is about a 10-minute walk from Exit 6 of Nambu Terminal Station on Line 3. There are no nearby tourist attractions. However, if you are looking for a comfortable, home-like accommodation, I recommend this place. It feels more like a pretty officetel than a hotel. For more detailed information, please refer to the description below⬇️ or the pinned comment. I booked all the hotels myself and paid for them myself. It's a reasonable rate of less than $110 per night on weekdays. It can accommodate up to 4 people. From the first impression, it feels very clean. You must take off your shoes to enter this place.

The refrigerator is also very large. It's convenient to use because it comes with laundry detergent. The kitchen utensils are very well equipped. It feels like a comfortable home! I recommend this place if you want a comfortable home-like feeling. The room has one queen size bed. I have a child, so I inspect my bedding thoroughly every time. Also check out the next video comparing residence hotels! There is a dressing table, various storage units, and a styler. And there is a mattress and blanket for two in the living room, so it is a room for four people in total. But the view outside the window is a bit disappointing. There are convenience stores and large marts very close by. It is a 5-minute walk away. The mart is very well-equipped and matches well with the residence. It was great to have a kitchen. There are many restaurants and cafes around the hotel. It is convenient to travel to nearby tourist attractions by subway. Two stops away is the famous Express Bus Terminal Shopping Center. If you go to the right, you will find Gangnam COEX and Lotte World. It's a shame that there are no famous tourist attractions around the hotel, but it's a hotel with clear pros and cons. The last hotel is between Hongdae and Yeouido Myeongdong. Hongdae to the northwest, Yeouido to the southwest, Myeongdong to the northeast, and Yongsan to the southeast. The Roynet Hotel video was also deleted due to a hard disk error. I will replace it with a photo. It takes about 5 minutes on foot from Exit 1 of Gongdeok Station on Line 5. All hotels are reviewed honestly after direct booking. No advertising. It's a reasonable rate of less than $110 per night on weekdays. This is a standard twin room with two double beds. Honestly, my first impression was that it was just an ordinary hotel, but when you look at it one by one, it is very delicate. First of all, the bathroom is very clean and feels good. I felt the attention to detail in all the facilities. If you subscribe, we will show you more useful information! The electrical outlets also stand out for their thoughtfulness. Even the basic room had an air purifier and humidifier. The bed was very clean and comfortable. The soundproofing was also good. There are washing machines, water purifiers, and microwaves on the 10th and 20th floors. The breakfast restaurant is located on the second floor and is private in the form of rooms. I was able to eat for 19,000 won because breakfast was not included in the room rate. There are famous food streets nearby, and there is a large supermarket. I recommend Jokbal Town. There is a large supermarket a 10-minute walk from the hotel. It is conveniently located for sightseeing around Hongdae, Myeongdong, and Hyundai Seoul, about 20 minutes away by public transportation.

{"video_id": "4cCQa_daRCw", "lang": "en", "full_text": "Let's compare two places: Orakai Suites in Jongno and UH Flat the Seocho in Gangnam.

It is located on Insadong Main Street, making it ideal for sightseeing. The rate is $200 per night for 3 people, including breakfast. This is a residence type with two bedrooms.

There are many delicious restaurants and cafes around. The second is a residence hotel located south of Seoul. It is close to the Express Bus Terminal Shopping Center, COEX, and Lotte World. It takes about 9 minutes on foot from Nambu Terminal Station on Line 3 to the hotel. None of the hotels featured in the video were sponsored by the hotel. All were booked directly. So I can review it objectively. The room rate is a little over $100 per night for four people. You must take off your shoes to enter this place. It feels very clean from the first impression. The bathroom is a little smaller than I thought, but it is very clean. This place feels more like visiting a friend's house than a hotel. $100 is a very reasonable price for this quality in Gangnam. The kitchen facilities are very clean and well organized. It was nice to use it because it also had laundry detergent. Honestly, the view was a little disappointing. But I am satisfied with the other facilities. The room has a queen size bed. The quality is mid-to-high level.

Small size is 34,000 won. Large size is 40,000 won. It's okay because Asian people have similar tastes. People in Europe or the United States can think of Schwein Haxen in Germany. The meat is tender and chewy. Even if it's not this restaurant Other nearby restaurants are also delicious. The soup in the middle is slightly spicy. The meat can be a little greasy It is also good to eat with alcohol or carbonated drinks. Loah begins a full-fledged hunt Even babies as young as 21 months eat well. Right next to Exit 8 nearby. There is a large Korean supermarket. It is convenient to use. There is Wine & More across from the accommodation. This is a chain store that sells a variety of alcoholic beverages at reasonable prices. I think it would be good to use it  when you want to cheer up.

I will show you 3 places in the center of Gwanghwamun and Myeongdong and 1 place in Gangnam. The first hotel is the conveniently located \"Stayrak\" hotel. The hotel is located in the heart of famous landmarks. The hotel is located 10 seconds away from Chungmuro ​​Station on Subway Lines 3 and 4.

It feels like two rooms are connected. For more information, please refer to the description below⬇️ or the pinned comment. The bed was clean and of average to upper quality. I'm checking more carefully because I have a child. The room view is a great view of Seoul Tower. The bathroom on the other side has similar facilities, but this one has a smaller bathtub.

I highly recommend the shared kitchen. You can eat as much ramen, cereal, milk, coffee, cocoa, etc. as you want. Washing machines and detergents are also available for free use. A shared office is also a great place to work. I feel like the public services are better than the guest rooms. Hahaha Deoksugung Palace is a 10-minute walk away. Across from the hotel is Cheonggyecheon. Most landmarks are within walking distance. It takes about 18 minutes to walk to Gyeongbokgung Palace. The third is a residence-type hotel that is great for sightseeing in Jongno and Anguk. The hotel is located on Insadong's main street, close to most of the famous tourist attractions.

Although it is away from Myeongdong and Gwanghwamun, it is in a good location for sightseeing, such as COEX and Express Bus Terminal Shopping Center. It takes about 9 minutes on foot from Nambu Terminal Station on Line 3 to the hotel. All hotels were booked and paid for directly without any sponsorship. There are no famous landmarks around the hotel. Transportation is not convenient either. However, if you want a clean and comfortable feeling like home, I recommend this place.

{"video_id": "L25auXlu02A", "lang": "en", "full_text": "The hotel looks like the Palace of Versailles The rooms also have a palace-like feel. There is an airport bus stop in front of the hotel! There are some great restaurants nearby! There is also a Hyundai Motor Company showroom around the hotel. Let's go together with \"Loah\" today! Come to Exit 1 of Hakdong Station on Subway Line 7. Go straight ahead. It took about 5 minutes to get here. After crossing the crosswalk, immediately turn right. It takes about 8 minutes to walk to the hotel. The airport bus stop is right in front of the hotel. It takes about 2 hours from the airport to the hotel. For more information, please refer to the description below⬇️ or the comments. The hotel is very fancy and pretty. There is a cafe in the front. On the right are the reception and breakfast room. Each platform has slightly different options and rates. I used Agoda. Please refer to the description or comments below⬇️ I chose the deluxe double room. The elevator is not a card touch system. I was assigned to the 14th floor. This is not a sponsorship. I paid for this 100% myself. To the right are a coat rack and a shoe rack. The shoe rack is also pretty. There is a piece of furniture that looks like a dressing table right next to it. And there are bathrobes, a safe, and disposable slippers. The slippers are quite thick. The bathroom is much prettier than I expected. Two shower towels, two small towels, and one foot towel are provided. The bathroom products are from \"Kohler\" and the bathtub is narrow and deep. Body lotion, shower gel, and shampoo are Penhaligon's products. Disposable products will be banned in Korea starting in April 2024. Disposable toothbrushes and toothpaste will not be provided. The remaining products are provided in a luxurious manner. The bidet and shower booth are well separated. We have Penhaligon's products. The shower room is very clean. A disadvantage is that water splashes outside the shower stall, making the sink floor slippery. On the right side of the room is a fancy minibar. Two basic coffee capsules, two tea bags, and two bottles of water are free. The quality of the two capsules and tea bags provided is good. Not bad for the price of a 5 star hotel. The TV is a smart TV. It plays YouTube and Netflix well. It is large compared to the room. There is a humidifier that was requested in advance. The table and stand are very classic. I was confused because the outlet was in the table drawer. The room design is very European and antique. However, the view from the room is a bit disappointing. We requested a king bed room for 2 adults and 1 infant. The bed condition was excellent. It was soft and smelled good. It's very fluffy. I requested a crib guard in advance. Fortunately, the bed size is bigger than I thought. I think we'll need to add a bed later when \"Loah\" gets a little bigger. Luckily, it was a super king size, which is slightly larger than a regular king size. The room was smaller than I thought, but I am satisfied because it is so pretty. If you are looking for this level of quality and value for money in Gangnam, Seoul, this is the place. Here are the temperature controller and outlet locations. It feels like you're in a luxury French hotel. The door is thick. You can't hear any outside noise at all. There is a cafe in the lobby. There are many old-fashioned antiques everywhere. There is a breakfast room and a nursing room. Further inside are a tailor shop and a bar. Every part of the hotel looks like a photo spot. There is a Japanese restaurant on the right side of the second floor. The view from the 2nd floor looking down on the 1st floor lobby is even better than the room view. Hahahaha On the left is a Chinese restaurant. Seriously, everywhere is a photo spot. The second basement floor has a fitness center and a barber shop. No entry for those under 16, No entry for those with excessive tattoos Originally, they said we shouldn't film, but I made a special request. The swimming pool and gym are available to general guests. Sauna is available for a fee. It was so well managed that it felt like looking into another underground world. The breakfast restaurant is located on the first floor. Open from 6:30 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. Adults 65,000 won, children under 13 years old 32,500 won. Children under 48 months old are free. Guests receive a 20% discount. If you compare different platforms in the description box below⬇️ or in the comments, there may be an option that includes breakfast. Personally, I really liked the friendliness of the staff and the atmosphere of the restaurant. However, the dish was not as satisfying as I thought. Maybe it's because I'm a bit picky. The bakery items were a little disappointing. Overall, most of the food tastes average. I think they probably used frozen dough. It's a shame that baby cutlery is a breakable item. Just go straight on the road to the right of the hotel for 5 minutes. I recommend \"Cheong Wa Ok\". I recommend \"Sundae Guk\" Regular 10,000 won Extra large 11,000 won We ordered 2 extra large bowls. It's a soup full of pork. \"Loah\" is also very tasty. If you walk about 8 minutes further down the road to the right of the restaurant, you will see the Hyundai Motor Company exhibition hall. Admission is free. Open until 9pm. If you are interested in cars, I highly recommend it. The first floor is a concept exhibition. The second and third floors are the history of Hyundai Motor Company. The fourth and fifth floors are where you can ride SUVs and electric vehicles. On the third floor, old Hyundai cars were on display. On the 4th floor, you can view and ride SUV vehicles. Coffee is served on the 4th and 5th floors. I recommend the Express Bus Terminal Station, which is 3 stops away from Hakdong Station on Line 7. It is connected to the subway station, so it is not affected by the outside weather. There are many things to see and eat. There is a concept exhibition on the first floor. I also recommend the \"Famille Station\" mall next door. I also recommend COEX, which is 30 minutes away from the hotel by bus or subway. There are lots of things to see, eat, and do. If you come in November or December, you can also see the Hyundai Department Store Christmas event."}

Second method - Exit 3 of Hoehyeon Station on Subway Line 4 There's an elevator right behind, so it's okay to carry heavy luggage. It is a 1-minute walk from the exit to the hotel. Third method - using the high-speed Arex train. You can get from the airport to Seoul Station in just 50 minutes by high-speed train. From here, it takes about 10 minutes to walk along Seoul 7017 Street to the hotel. The hotel lobby has a casual and warm atmosphere. The staff were very friendly and welcoming. Check-in 3pm Check-out 12pm Depending on the situation, it is possible to check in a little earlier. Rates vary slightly from site to site. I'll put a direct link in the description box below⬇️ or in the comments We do not advertise for money from hotels. We book directly and express ourselves honestly. It was convenient because the six elevators moved very quickly. Today I will show you Seoul King Suite Room 2036! The first impression of the room was that it was very bright and casual, and the view was great! There is a king size bed on the right. The view from the bed is amazing. In reality, Seoul Tower is very large, but it appears small in the video. I loved the feeling of the bed wrapping around my body. I liked it so I asked the hotel about it and they said it was a Simmons product made by the hotel itself. Next to the bedroom, there are four bathrobes, four disposable slippers, an iron, and a safe. Each booth has a separate bidet and shower. The view from the bathtub is also the same as the Seoul Tower view. The drainage system is well-maintained around the bathtub. There are two sinks and plenty of towels. Disposable products will be restricted in Korea from April 2024, so toothbrushes and toothpaste will not be provided. The atmosphere is really the best!! \"Loah\" keeps asking me to go to the pool~ hahaha There are various chargers prepared on the round table. The TV wasn't a smart TV.  It's a shame there was only one bed. “Voco”’s unique colors stand out. You can see the hotel parking lot! The blackout curtains were really great! The fridge was huge!  All the drinks inside were free. There are 8 bottles in total, 4 bottles of water in the refrigerator and 4 bottles next to the coffee machine. There was a small sink, but no special cooking utensils. \"Loah\" keeps whining about going to the pool. It was really nice because there was no noise at all, the view was good, and it was clean. There's one more bathroom! There is only a bidet and a sink here. It's a shame there's no TV in the living room, but~ The atmosphere is good and it's clean, so I'm really satisfied. For the Wowpass, please refer to the description below⬇️ or the comment link There is a convenience store behind the elevator, so it is very convenient. There is a large cafe next to the elevator. There is a Burger King next to the large cafe. There was a restaurant on the second floor. There is a fitness center and swimming pool on the 3rd floor. The gym is open 24 hours a day. The space was a bit small, but the equipment was very clean. The swimming pool is open from 6am to 10pm. It's a shame that the lockers don't have locks. It had a small jacuzzi so it was great for little ones to play in. I think the water temperature is around 32 degrees. I didn't know that large tubes and beach balls were prohibited. Fortunately, it was before closing time so there was no one there, and the person in charge was understanding. There is a club lounge on the 18th floor. I thought the door was closed hahahaha After checking the room number, you can sit where you want. I like it so much, the atmosphere is so good I was able to eat light chocolate and cookies. Juice, soft drinks, coffee and tea are also available. The dessert was average.  The coffee was delicious. But the view is still so beautiful. Oh!! But there's a twist Happy hour is from 5:30 PM to 8 PM! The taste of the food and the atmosphere are so good The quality of the food was higher than I expected. I was planning to eat a moderate amount here and then go out to eat, but the food here was so delicious that I ended up eating here. I was very satisfied with the lounge at the Voco Hotel. Open from 6:30 am to 10:30 am. Because there are many foreign guests, the menu features Korean bibimbap. Unfortunately, the bread is a bit disappointing. The tea was so delicious There wasn't a lot of food variety, but the taste was okay! Strangely enough, there were three types of bacon. Baby bowls and forks were also provided, and the surrounding atmosphere was nice. You can see Seoulro 7017 on the left side of the hotel. You can walk to Seoul Station. You can see the view of Seoul along the way. It took about 10 minutes to get here. Across from the hotel is Namdaemun Market. It took about 3 minutes to get here. From here, it is a children's clothing wholesale market. This place and the Poki Wholesale Market are popular. It's a great place to buy gifts for people around you. The price is cheap but the quality is good. The price ranges from 5,000 to 10,000 won per piece. The price ranges from 5,000 to 10,000 won per piece. It's fun to browse the market because there are so many different foods. This is in front of Exit 5 of Hoehyeon Station across from the hotel. The fruits here are cheap and delicious. To the right of the hotel are Myeongdong and Shinsegae Department Store. From Exit 1 of Hoehyeon Station, cross the street to Shinsegae Department Store. Go straight ahead. Admission is free. Closed on Mondays. There is a lot to see here, from Korean currency to foreign currency. It's fun for everyone from children to adults. It's so big that I think you'll probably be able to see it in about 2~3 hours. Loah mom is playing a prank hahahaha There are many different and interesting programs. From November to January, you can enjoy media art every night at Exit 1 of the Hoehyeon Underground Shopping Center."}

Go straight ahead If you walk for about 2 minutes,  you will see the Seoul City Tour bus stop. If you get a chance, definitely ride it It took about 3 minutes to get to the \"Koreana\" hotel. There is an airport bus stop right in front of the hotel. The \"GLOCALOCA\" hotel is located  on the 19th and 20th floors of the \"Koreana\" hotel. The area surrounding the hotel is full of famous landmarks. I booked it for $105 per night for 2 people. If you come to the 20th floor,  you can check in at the welcome desk. Check-in is at 3pm and check-out is at 11am. As soon as you enter, there is a clean bathroom on the right. As soon as you enter, there are 4 disposable slippers and a hanger on the right. The shoes were thin but sturdy. There is a clean restroom on the left. 8 towels, toothbrushes, and toothpaste are provided. There is also cleansing foam and hand wash! The shower room is clean, but there is no door in the shower booth. It was nice to have a middle door The first feeling was warm There is a very small refrigerator and fire extinguisher on the right. The fridge is a bit small. But the shared kitchen is very well-equipped. The TV is a smart TV that can watch Netflix, YouTube, etc. The table is wide so it is very useful The windows are double-glazed to block out noise. The view from the room overlooks the entire Gwanghwamun. Women's unique sensibility The bed is not of luxury hotel quality. It is ordinary. The mattress is moderately firm. It's a queen size bed. There was no crib guard here, so I pushed the bed against the wall. Overall, spacious room for the price, average bed But, good location for sightseeing and convenient transportation! But! I really like the shared kitchen. Let's take a look together! The communal kitchen is much nicer than I expected. Open 24 hours. Complimentary coffee, cocoa, ramen, cereal and milk. Air fryer, rice cooker, ice maker, microwave, electric range, dishwasher It's much neater than I thought. A water purifier, a clean sink, and various kitchen utensils are provided. You can taste Korean ramen to your heart's content. The feeling of space is also very cozy. There are two types of cereal available. There is also a communal kitchen on the 19th floor, but it is a bit smaller. All cooking facilities are well equipped. This is a shared refrigerator for guests. It is smaller than the 20th floor, but it is a good facility. You can see the shared office right away. There are spaces from single-person spaces to open spaces. In my opinion, I like the facilities more than the rooms. There is even a private meeting room. There are also public, clean restrooms here. The communal laundry room has a washing machine that you can use free of charge. There is one large washing machine and one dryer, and free detergent is also provided. There is no pool or gym, but I am satisfied. If you walk to the left of the hotel for about 6 minutes, you will reach Gwanghwamun Square. If you walk for about 10 more minutes, you will reach Gyeongbokgung Palace. You can take a free commemorative photo around 12:10 PM. It's great to rent a hanbok and wear it and take pretty pictures! For more information, please refer to the comments below ⬇️ This time, walk to the right of the hotel for about 3 minutes. If you walk 2 more minutes from here, you will reach Deoksugung Palace. Turn right first! If you go up for about 2 more minutes,  there is an elevator on the right. Press the \"R\" floor and come to the rooftop. This place offers a great view that is not well known. Go to Deoksugung Palace. It's about a 4-minute walk. As soon as you enter, you can see souvenirs at the \"sarang\" cafe on the right. It's pretty and of good quality. You can have a great time at Deoksugung Palace. Across from the hotel are City Hall Plaza and Cheonggyecheon Stream. You can have a good time here too This is not a famous restaurant, but it is a place worth experiencing. There is a “BBQ village” right next to Cheonggyecheon. Luckily, I was assigned a room. If you walk about 5 minutes from here towards Jongno, there is a famous restaurant called “Gwanghwamun Mijin.” There is usually a waiting time of about 20 minutes. Buckwheat soba and pork bossam are famous. Please leave comments and likes for our family"}

There are two types of airport buses:  \"6002\" and \"6015\" It's so close that it feels like my own private bus. The lobby and front desk are simple and clean. It is a very reasonable price considering  the quality of the room and the transportation. The hotel is very comfortable,  as many people still don't know about it. The toilet, shower room, and sink are all separate. The bathtub and washbasin are  high-end Italian products. Although Korean hotels have restrictions  on disposable items, this place provides disposable  toothbrushes, toothpaste, and razors. I personally like disposable slippers,  but I understand the environmental implications. The view is much nicer than I thought. You can see Seoul Tower well. The room condition is quite satisfactory overall.  It is well soundproofed and there is no smell. For a room of this quality in the heart of Seoul,  $80 per night is a really good deal. Three bottles of basic water are provided,  but you can continue to get more yourself on the first floor. We keep doing hotel reviews and  this place is really great valuefor money. There are no ancillary facilities in the hotel building. But the rooftop was pretty, Free 24-hour parking is available. The best part! The hotel lunch buffet and cafe are famous, The airport bus and subway are close, and there is a convenience store nearby. The famous pildong hambak restaurant  across the street from the hotel Neoguri Ramyun restaurant  right in front of Exit 9 of Myeongdong Station Myeongdong is 1 subway stop away, 15 minutes on foot.

The bathroom is small, but has a bidet. The bathroom was equipped with basic amenities. The bathtub is fine in width, but I think it's a little short in length. The room was newly renovated and very clean. On the left is a queen-size bed, and on the right is a single bed. You can see a lot of Voco's trademark colors, yellow and blue. I didn't have high expectations, but it was not only clean, I actually felt so refreshed when I woke up. I asked the hotel about the brand of bed. They say it's a Simmons product manufactured in-house by the hotel. But there was one thing that was disappointing.  There was no crib guard for infants. The next morning I was so refreshed that I talked to my family. The feeling of being wrapped around my body was amazing. Personally I don't like fabric, but this place was very clean. The view from Seoul Tower was really beautiful. However, it looks small in the video, which is a shame.  In reality, it looks much bigger.

{"video_id": "fANzTKMO1gI", "lang": "en", "full_text": "Today, I'm going to share some great family-friendly hotels in Seoul. I recommend staying in central Seoul. The first hotel is the Voco Hotel, which is close to Namdaemun Market. There are many tourist attractions within walking distance. The hotel is a 20-second walk from Exit 3 of Hoehyeon Station on Subway Line 4. There is an airport bus stop right in front of the hotel. The rate for a family of three is in the mid-$200s per night. This room has one single bed and one queen-size bed. My first impression was that it was bright and clean. The bathroom was small but very convenient and clean. The bathtub was a little smaller than I thought. Since it had just opened, everything felt very clean. Cons: No outlets near the bed, and some lights couldn’t be turned off. However, the bed quality is good. The mattress and blanket were both super comfortable. The view of Seoul Tower was really nice. Unfortunately, Seoul Tower looks quite small on camera. I don't like the fabric of the sofa, but this place was very clean. There are multiple charging ports on the desk. There is a fitness center and swimming pool on the 3rd floor of the hotel. The facilities are also very clean. The pool was small, but convenient to use. There is a club lounge on the 18th floor. The view of Seoul Tower was very nice, and the lounge atmosphere was also nice. During the day, you can enjoy simple drinks and desserts such as chocolate and cookies. However, the menu and atmosphere changed completely during dinner time, so we were really satisfied. We recommend including lounge access when making your reservation. There is a restaurant on the second floor. There are not many kinds, but the taste was good. All of our videos are not paid advertisements. We booked them ourselves. The restaurant has a casual atmosphere and the tables are spaced widely apart. Most of the famous tourist attractions are within walking distance. Across the street from the hotel is Namdaemun Market. You can find children's clothing wholesalers and a variety of food. For more information, please refer to the description below⬇️ or the pinned comment. The second hotel is one with very convenient transportation. You can reach famous tourist attractions within 20 minutes by public transportation. The hotel is located 10 seconds away from the exit of Chungmuro ​​Station. The airport bus stop is right in front of the hotel, so it's very convenient. The hotel lobby is very casual. Rooms that sleep up to six people start at around $200 per night. I'll show you a 6-person room with 3 double beds. All of our videos are not paid advertisements. We booked them ourselves. It's a real treat to be able to stay in such a large room in downtown Seoul for $200. The facilities also used high-end equipment. I was really surprised by the large spa facilities. The bed quality is mid to high. There are two each of TV, sofa, refrigerator, and bathroom. There are three double beds in total. We have a young child so we check the beds very carefully. The view of Seoul Tower is very beautiful. The bathroom on the other side is also very luxurious. It has a beautiful bathtub. Hanok Village and Myeongdong are a 10-minute walk away. I highly recommend Namsangol Hanok Village. I don't recommend Mondays. Myeongdong is a 10-minute walk away, making it ideal for shopping and sightseeing. The third hotel is located in Gwanghwamun. There are so many tourist attractions within walking distance from the hotel. It takes about 5 minutes to walk from Gwanghwamun Station on Line 5 to the hotel. There is an airport bus stop right in front of the hotel. The \"Glocaloca\" hotel occupies two floors, the 19th and 20th floors of the Koreana Hotel. Very reasonable rates, starting at around $100 per night for 4 people. Today we're introducing a room with two queen-size beds. All of our videos are not paid advertisements. We booked them ourselves. The bathroom is plain and clean. Most Korean hotels these days do not provide disposable toothbrushes. But this place does. For more information, please refer to the description below⬇️ or the pinned comment. It was nice to be able to see the entire Gwanghwamun area. However, if there is a rally, you may hear some noise. The bed quality is average. We have a baby so we check the bed very carefully. Overall, I liked the room as it was large for the price. There's a real twist! The shared kitchen is so clean and nice. You can eat as much cereal, coffee, cocoa, ramen, etc. as you like. You can use the washing machine and detergent for free. The shared office is also a really great space. Personally, I like shared service better than rooms. Hahahaha Both Deoksugung and Gyeongbokgung Palaces are within walking distance. Across from the hotel is Cheonggyecheon. Gwanghwamun Square is a 9-minute walk away. For more information, please refer to the description below⬇️ or the pinned comment. The last hotel is a residence-style hotel in Insa-dong. Here too, there are famous tourist attractions within 20 minutes by public transportation. It takes about 8 minutes from Anguk Station or Jongno 5-ga Station on Line 3 to the hotel. The airport bus stop is also near the subway station. It is located on Insadong Main Street, so the location is very good. The rate is around $200 for 3 people, including breakfast. The room type I’m showing you today is a two-bedroom. The first impression is that it feels classic. The kitchen facilities are truly perfect. All the hotels in the video were not paid by the hotel. I booked and used them all directly. This is a great room type for families with children like us to stay in. It's really clean. For more information, please refer to the description below⬇️ or the pinned comment. The second room has a queen size bed. The bed quality is mid-to-high level. It is very clean. There is a master bedroom inside. This place is also very clean. It's a king size bed. The bed condition is also fine. The view is a general city view. The master bedroom bathroom has a bathtub. The bathtub was of average size, and the tub was also clean. The second bathroom has a washer and dryer. However, there was no detergent. For more information, please refer to the description below⬇️ or the pinned comment. The fitness center is also well maintained. There was a kids room, but I was satisfied with just having it. There is a large main pool, a smaller pool, and a jacuzzi. Breakfast was okay, but there was very little variety. If you don't feel like eating outside in the morning = Recommended The hotel is located on Insadong Street, making it ideal for sightseeing. There are many famous restaurants and cafes around. Please subscribe and like so that I can reward you with better videos. Thank you."}

Come to the musical instrument store as shown in the video. Once you cross the traffic light You will see the hotel building in front of you, turn right It took about 5 minutes to get here. The hotel lobby has a cozy feel. Check-in time is 4:00 PM, and check-out time is 11:00 AM. We booked on Agoda for $220 for 3people. There are 2-bed deluxe and 2-bed premier apartments, and I will introduce you to the slightly more expensive premier apartment. To check in, insert and remove the room card. As soon as you enter, there is a shoe rack and  many storage cabinets on the right. Indoor slippers are not disposable items. There is a kitchen on the left There is a dining table for four. The kitchen is well equipped with gas stove,  oven, rice cooker, toaster, etc. Pots, frying pans, etc. are very clean. The refrigerator is very clean and very big.  However, they do not provide bottled water. I booked a room for 3 people,  but all kitchen utensils are provided for 4 people. It looks really clean and well organized. If you are looking for a clean residence hotel,  this is the perfect place. The sink is very clean. The microwave oven also has good performance. There is a dishwasher. The TV is big, but it doesn't have OTT service. There is a small study area.  It feels like a bit of a service area. The view was good.   You can see the park and the Blue House. A clean residence hotel in the heart of Seoul.  I highly recommend it. There are quite a few doors This is the second room on the right. There is a queen size bed,  a small desk and storage space. The bed mattress is a slightly firm style,  and the pillows and blankets are soft. Because it is a central heating and cooling system, there are control systems located throughout the system so that it can be adjusted. This is the innermost master room. There is a king size bed and a small TV. The bed was very clean A slightly firm mattress and soft blankets and pillows It was raining and gloomy,  but the view was pretty good. There is a large closet.  There is a safe and a bathrobe. There are hangers, hair dryers, etc. There is an empty space with nothing.  You can see Seoul Tower well from here. This is the master bedroom bathroom. Starting in April 2024, a law restricting the provision of disposable products will be enacted, banning the provision of disposable toothbrushes, toothpaste, razors, etc. The shower room is very waterproof. The bathtub is narrow and long.  There is absolutely no water stains or mold. The toilet is a bidet. There is regular shampoo,  body shampoo, and body lotion. There is no smell in the bathroom and it is very clean. The second bathroom has a washing machine.  However, there is no detergent. There are small stairs. The shower room is very well waterproofed. The toilet is a regular toilet. There is only regular shampoo and body shampoo here. The rooms are clean and of a decent quality,  so I recommend it. Now, shall we go and see the hotel facilities? Touch the sticker side of the room card,  select the desired floor, and press Enter. The gym is very large and well maintained. All the facilities are located on the second floor. The kids room has only one facility and is rather small. But, regardless, the kids love it so much. There is a swimming pool right next door.  The facilities are better than I thought. The small pool is about 60cm deep.  The adult pool is about 1.2m deep. There is a restaurant right next to the pool. As soon as you enter, there are drinks on the right. The restaurant is spacious. The variety of bread is a bit disappointing. It costs about $13.50 per person,  so the selection is limited. Carrot soup and seaweed soup and scrambled eggs Tomato pasta, rice and pork cutlet There are various sauces and seaweed. There's pineapple lettuce dressing green grapes and banana. There are bowls and plates and spoons for babies,  and there is cereal and milk. There aren't many varieties, but the taste was good. The tomato pasta and seaweed soup were especially delicious. \"Onion\" located at Exit 3 of Anguk Station A special place where you can eat Korean bread in a Hanok I recommend it for the atmosphere rather than the taste. More than 90% of our guests are foreign tourists. I recommend Jongro Bossam Alley. \"Jongno 3-ga Janggun Oyster Bossam\" You can enjoy bossam, gamjatang,  and oysters for 38,000 won. For more information, please check the description or comments below. Insadong's main street is just  to the left of the hotel's main entrance. There are lots of things to see and places to buy gifts. There are also unique brick sands. There's a fun convenience store on the second floor. Robots make lattes. Robots make ice cream. Robots make pizza. But you can cook Korean ramen yourself.  Hahahaha"}
{"video_id": "hycdbYi3Khg", "lang": "en", "full_text": "10 seconds from airport bus stop  & subway station to hotel Let's go with \"Loah\" today! Take subway lines 3 and 4  to Chungmuro ​​Station, exit 8. There is an airport bus stop immediately to the right. The hotel is right behind exit 8! It's so close that there's no need to explain. The hotel is located right in front of  airport bus stops 6001 and 6015. For more information, please see the  description or comments below. The hotel I will introduce to you today is suitable for  4 or more people (up to 6 people). The hotel information desk is small,  but neat and cozy. You will be given a total of 4 room card keys.  The elevator is very comfortable. The suite is located on the 10th floor and has two rooms. We were assigned room 1001. It was much wider than I thought We paid about $180 USD per night for 6 people. 3 double beds 2 bathrooms 2 refrigerators 2 tvs The toilet, shower room, and sink are all separate. This place provides amenities such as disposable  toothbrushes and toothpaste. There is a large spa facility. You can see Seoul Tower from your room. The bed is in good condition. There is a safe, a hanger, and slippers next to the bed. There is a sofa, a TV, and a refrigerator. You can get bottled water for free from the refrigerator next  to the front desk on the first floor. Here too, there is a refrigerator, hangers, slippers and a safe. It's a little disappointing that these aren't disposable slippers. We used the two double beds here by putting them  together to create a spacious space. The bed is very soft. You can see the Seoul Tower view  from anywhere in the room. Another bathroom features a luxurious bathtub. Likewise, the toilet, shower room, and faucet are separate. Amenities such as disposable toothbrushes  and toothpaste are also provided. The bathroom fixtures are luxurious Italian products. The luxurious and large bathtub is attractive. It's hard to find this level of quality for the price  of one night in a six-person hotel in the heart of Seoul. The spa facilities in particular were great for parties. It took an hour and a half to fill the spa halfway with water. If you have a family of 4 or more,  I would definitely recommend this place. Hotel facilities are minimal. The rooftop garden is great for a little healing. 24-hour free parking is available. But the biggest advantage - being close to the airport bus  and subway station is the best advantage. And there's a large convenience store right next door. There's a delicious hamburger steak  restaurant across the street. There is a Neoguri Ramyun restaurant  right in front of Exit 9 of Myeongdong Station. You can eat the ramen you want  with the toppings you want. The staff will be there to assist you. Namsangol Hanok Village is about  an 8-minute walk from the hotel. Myeongdong is one subway stop away or about a 15-minute walk away. How about the stayrak hotel I recommended today?  Was it helpful?
